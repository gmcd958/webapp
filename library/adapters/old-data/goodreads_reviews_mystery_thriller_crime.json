I read it in 2 nights and couldn't put it down. The book is about the quantum theory of many worlds which states that all decisions we make throughout our lives basically create branches, and that each possible path through the decision tree can be thought of as a parallel world. And in this book, someone invents a way to switch between these worlds. This was nicely alluded to/foreshadowed in this quote: \n \"I think about all the choices we've made that created this moment. Us sitting here together at this beautiful table. Then I think of all the possible events that could have stopped this moment from ever happening, and it all feels, I don't know...\" \"What?\" \"So fragile.\" Now he becomes thoughtful for a moment. He says finally, \"It's terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every choice we could possibly make, branches into a new world.\" \n This book can't be discussed without spoilers. It is a book about choice and regret. Ever regret not chasing the girl of your dreams so you can focus on your career? Well Jason2 made that choice and then did regret it. Clearly the author is trying to tell us to optimize for happiness - to be that second rate physics teacher at a community college if it means you can have a happy life. I'm being snarky because while there is certainly something to that, you also have to have meaning in your life that comes from within. I thought the book was a little shallow on this dimension. In fact, all the characters were fairly shallow. Daniela was the perfect wife. Ryan the perfect antithesis of Jason. Amanda the perfect loyal traveling companion, etc. This, plus the fact that the book was weak on the science are what led me to take a few stars off - but I'd still read it again if I could go back in time - was a very fun and engaging read. \n If you want to really minimize regret, you have to live your life to avoid it in the first place. Regret can't be hacked, which is kind of the point of the book. My favorite book about regret is Remains of the Day. I do really like the visualization of the decision tree though - that is a powerful concept. \n \"Every moment, every breath, contains a choice. But life is imperfect. We make the wrong choices. So we end up living in a state of perpetual regret, and is there anything worse? I built something that could actually eradicate regret. Let you find worlds where you made the right choice.\" Daniela says, \"Life doesn't work that way. You live with your choices and learn. You don't cheat the system.\"", "date_added": "Tue Nov 15 11:29:22 -0800 2016", "date_updated": "Mon Mar 20 23:40:27 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Sat Mar 18 23:22:42 -0700 2017", "started_at": "Fri Mar 17 23:45:40 -0700 2017", "n_votes": 22, "n_comments": 0}

A grad student (Eric) has left his annotated copy of SOT (Ship of Theseus) in the library, and an undergrad (Jen) finds it and replies to his annotations. This leads to them making exciting discoveries about the book, and also falling in love. \n The first thing is this book is just beautifully printed. It looks and feels like a classic book, to the point where people would ask me why I'm reading such an old book. The marginalia feels real, and I can only imagine how hard that was to print. This is one that will be cool to keep on the shelves. Only complaint is the inserts are a cool idea, but they fall out all the time, and at this point I have no idea which pages they were supposed to be on. \n The most interesting thing about this book to me is that it's a blueprint for how people discuss books. Sometimes they discuss the content of the book. Other times they use the content as a jumping off point to have a personal discussion. The nature of this book shows both, almost split 50/50. A key difference with this book - and the genius of it - is that most of us have to rely on memory to start a conversation with someone about a particular event or passage in the book. Here, our characters can literally underline a phrase like \"relationships\" and then talk about what is happening in their relationship at the moment. \n One thing I didn't realize until later in the book is that the ship of Theseus is a real thing - it's an ancient Greek philosophical question - if you replace all the parts of something, is it still the same object? This inspires the ship that S is captured on, which sails through the mists of time, always getting fixed when needed. It's a ship that can't die. Or a series of ships :) \n I found the story of Jen & Eric a lot more compelling than the SOT story. They were real characters that you could relate to. SOT felt like books you read in english class - a bit obtuse - and I still don't understand it all. But don't get me wrong - it's a pretty cool story. I particularly enjoyed the themes - like how it all begins and ends with water, and also how it was a lot about Straka's regret to fulfill his mission instead of living his life with his true love. Kind of like how S was on a mission, but didn't really know why - he just found himself caught up in it.", "date_added": "Wed Mar 26 13:51:30 -0700 2014", "date_updated": "Tue Sep 23 01:44:36 -0700 2014", "read_at": "Sun Sep 21 00:00:00 -0700 2014", "started_at": "Sat Jul 26 00:00:00 -0700 2014", "n_votes": 7, "n_comments": 0}

It really is two stories - the story of the murder mystery, and that of political climate in Italy at the time. And of course, they nicely interweave throughout. \n The history the book brought was one of my favorite parts. I learned about how the church controlled so much of the world, how even then it was already starting to fall from power, why saints are so prevalent in Italy, and more. I learned about Franciscans and Dolcians and minorites, and poverity and false monks. Poverty was a big theme, which came through on several levels: rebellions by poor people and religious leaders stepping in to lead the masses, and also an a debate about the role the Church should have in society. \n I loved brother William of baskerville. He was Sherlock Holmes-esque (so that can't be a coincidence he's from Baskerville right?) in his deductive reasoning and approach. I think my favorite moment of his was when he had no time left to solve the crime he said \"when a man has little time, he must take care to maintain his calm. We must act as if we had eternity before us.\" \n I took one star off because I often found myself skipping large sections that went into flowery details of something (often history) that just seemed irrelevant. \n The book was also a lot about change. The monks were so set in their ways and in their dogma that you could see how it likely took generations before a viewpoint could really change. The focus on humor for instance and the dogmatic viewpoint of Jorge was in my opinion simply nothing more than fear of change. We all know that the introduction of humor and the divine comedy didn't ruin the world. \n The library was one of the greatest in the world at the time. I would love to have seen it. Yet it was almost impossible to access, and that very lack of accessibility is what ultimately led to it's destruction.

It was basically a big logic tree, where each possibly outcome in the real world was accounted for in the program. It would have taken a lot of preparation and attention to detail to go through all the possible outcomes and not missing anything, and one bug could make the whole thing fail. Wouldn't that be embarrassing? I guess Sobol had some good unit tests? \n In the second half of the book (trying to not give anything away), the AI goes beyond what I think a skilled programmer could do today.

The baby was never found. Angela and her husband Nick carried on after their devastating loss but Angela never fully recovered. When the bones of an infant are found at a construction site, she is sure the body is that of her long-gone Baby Alice. \n Kate is a brilliant newspaper journalist who uncovers news stories the old-fashioned way: through leg work and research and determination. She was also featured in the author's previous book 'The Widow' which I am now going to read! I loved Kate's style. While this book started off just a tiny bit slow, it picked up the pace in the middle and thundered toward an unbelievably shocking conclusion. \n \"I've always thought that's a funny saying. Let sleeping dogs lie. Because sleeping dogs always wake up eventually, don't they?\" \n Emma is married to a university professor many years her senior. She is devastated by the news of the \"Building Site Baby' but why? She has no apparent ties to Angela's family. Emma has had a difficult relationship with her mother Jude but it seems the two are trying to make peace with each other now that Emma is grown and married. But Emma has secrets of her own that will devastate everyone close to her when they are revealed. \n The multiple points of view are executed brilliantly. Each narrator has their own unique voice and are each vital to the story. \n 'The Child' is an imaginative and surprising thriller. While the writing is filled with British slang and customs, that only added to my enjoyment of the story. \n There are many twists and turns to this book and the ending was far more touching than I expected from what I though would be a suspense novel. The conclusion was enormously satisfying! Highly recommend this book for all thriller fans as well as anyone who loves a great story. \n \"People say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

'Losing the Light' is a top favorite read for me this year (released in 2016). So when I got the chance to read this novella to \"tide\" me over until her next full-length release, I jumped on it!! 'Broken Bay' is a fast-paced, modern tale about a group of old friends who gather for a bachelorette weekend. Even though this is a short story, the characters are all well-developed and the setting quite detailed. And the cover is perfect!!

How will it end?\" \n What a perfect book to read during eclipse week 2017!! This taut and fast-paced thriller kept me on my toes until the very end. And what an ending! Kit and Laura are a young married couple who chase eclipses all over the world. It is an exciting, exotic lifestyle, hypnotic and mysterious all at once. \n \"Then the darkness comes. Without the countdown in the sky, it's pure and instant. All the street lights in the town below come on, so quickly it's like sparks igniting. Now, in the darkness, disappointment is replaced by the familiar thrill of totality. But this time it's different.\" \n The book begins in 2015 with Laura's point of view. She lives in London but she and her husband live anonymously. Why? The answer to that question unfolds slowly over the course of the book. We learn that Laura and Kit witnessed an violent assault during an eclipse festival years earlier and were witnesses for the prosecution during the trial of the attacker, Jamie. The trial was emotionally draining and physically exhausting for everyone and is described in minute detail. \n The brutal assault is also described in vivid detail so I was curious as to how any doubt could arise about Jamie's guilt or innocence. Just remember: there are many sides to each story. \n \"The moment you think about an act in terms of how, you are already halfway to doing it.\" \n We learn that Laura is now pregnant with twins but wants Kit to \"chase\" an upcoming eclipse while she stays behind in London, even though she is extremely paranoid about his travels. He has been an eclipse chaser since he was young and they both want to continue their adventures after their children are born. \n They live in fear that Beth, the young woman who had been raped years before, will find them again. She had befriended them after the trial of her attacker, but then became wildly unstable. Laura and Kit became convinced they had to disappear \"off the grid\" so that she would never find them again. \n This book was incredibly gripping and thought-provoking. It is told over the course of many years and features vivid characters and brilliantly-researched settings. The author forces the reader to confront their own morals and ask: What would you do in the same situation? \n \"Until that day I'd been thinking about the campaign in binary terms: either Jamie was in denial, or he was calling the world's bluff. But now a third possibility was inescapable, and one in which I was horrifically culpable. What if Jamie was innocent?\" \n This book was addictive and wildly surprising. The references to eclipses are fascinating and the format of the book is divided into the parts of an eclipse. With my husband and daughter away \"eclipse chasing\" while I was reading this book, the subject matter was even more compelling! With themes of loyalty, guilt and devotion, this book really did it for me. I highly recommend this creative and thrilling story!", "date_added": "Sat Feb 18 18:01:40 -0800 2017", "date_updated": "Thu Aug 24 12:29:27 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Wed Aug 23 21:17:20 -0700 2017", "started_at": "Sun Aug 20 21:34:05 -0700 2017", "n_votes": 6, "n_comments": 0}

This house might be simple, but it's ambition is extraordinary.\" \n A fantastic psychological thriller that I could not put down!! Would you be willing to give up almost all of your worldly possessions for a chance live in a stunning home for very little rent? That is the fascinating premise of this book by JP Delaney, a pseudonym for a well-known writer. I read that the author did not want to reveal his/her gender because the book is told from a female point of view. I did not know this when I first read a sample, and the author succeeded in making me feel as though I was inside the narrators' minds. \n The brilliant architect Edward Monkford has designed One Folgate Street in London, a high-tech house with cutting edge design. Edward is a follower of minimalism to the extreme, so much so that the tenants must agree to abide by his extreme de-cluttering rules and regulations. But he sees his rules as so much more than control and firmly believes that a house really can change you from within. If you have to de-clutter your life, then you will begin to see what is truly important in life, and you will free your mind to become a better person. \n Emma and Jane are both looking for a fresh start. They are required to fill out a stringent and lengthy application in order to pass on to the final level of approval, which is a very brief meeting with the owner and designer of One Folgate Street. The rent is low and the house is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. \n Edward is difficult, mysterious, brilliant, moody...but the chance to live in the magnificent home is so tempting, the women overlook all of this in order for a chance to live at One Folgate Street. The home is equipped with the latest high-tech gadgets, and the tenants must answer periodic questionnaires in order to continue living in the house. The evaluations test their ethics, their physical well-being and their state of mind and are quite literally crucial to continues living in the house. \n \"That's all anyone's looking for really, isn't it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?\" \n The descriptions of the home are absolutely enthralling. I am still thinking about this book weeks after finishing! The idea of extreme de-cluttering is very thought-provoking and is woven inextricably into this intriguing story. Is Edward as dangerous and unhinged as everyone seems to think he is? This is a classic tale where NOTHING is as it seems. I literally read this book over the course of 2 days and was shocked by the surprising conclusion. \n The story is told from the point of view of Emma, who is seeking a safe neighborhood and a secure home after a recent break-in, and Jane, who has suffered a tragic loss and is seeking a new beginning. Their stories converge in a creative way and I loved how the author kept me guessing until the very last page. The house literally plays a central role in this book and to me is one of the main characters in this story. If you are looking for a thrilling read that will challenge you and your boundaries, then \"The Girl Before' is for you!! I LOVED it and highly recommend it for all fans of domestic thrillers. \n (Copy provided by the publisher via NetGalley.)", "date_added": "Fri Jan 13 15:25:11 -0800 2017", "date_updated": "Mon Mar 13 23:27:10 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Mon Mar 06 12:33:27 -0800 2017", "started_at": "Sun Mar 05 16:13:09 -0800 2017", "n_votes": 6, "n_comments": 0}

I FELT Cass's hysteria and fear. The last part of the book was thrilling and surprising and gave me everything I love about thrillers. I highly recommend this one for all fans of this genre and even if you want to step outside your usual genre. Cass was a memorable heroine and I was cheering for her all throughout the book.

I'll try not to reveal too much about the plot because it is a shocker! Zoe is a stunning Manhattan socialite, living in a world of charity dinners, beautiful apartments and gorgeous vacation homes. She has everything she could want at her fingertips: a designer wardrobe, a private cook and romantic getaways with her perfect husband, Henry. \n \"I stop protesting his indulgence, when he buys me clothing and shoes and jewelry. I stop looking for the catch. There doesn't seem to be one. So what do you do?\" \n But right from the beginning, there are cracks in Zoe's perfect life, and we don't know whether it is from her damaged past or from someone or something in her current life. She is growing bored as Henry's wife, and longs for her younger self, when she had a job, friends and freedom to do whatever she wanted. She begins to chafe in her perfect little bubble. \n \"I can prepare dinner and I have on occasion, but he always insists we ask Penny, which irritates me. I have all day in this echoing apartment, my own voice bouncing off the sterile, bare walls and marble floors. Sometimes I wonder if uselessness can kill a person.\" \n Zoe is witty, sarcastic and smart, and all of the characters were engaging and interesting. I loved her connection with Henry, and even though she was in love with him, she never quite felt that she really \"knew\" him at all. \n \"Henry is a product of a traditional household and paternalism runs deep in his veins, which I find both charming and a little infuriating, depending on the day.\" \n But is Zoe just imagining things where they do not exist? Henry is the perfect husband and all he wants to do is please her. The author did a great job at creating characters I really cared about. With all his odd mannerisms, Henry seems to be in love with his wife and do everything for her. After a charity event, Zoe begins to question her past and seeks out certain people that she had thought were long gone from her life. I don't want to give anything away because this book is full of surprises and fantastic twists and turns. I absolutely loved Zoe's slow awakening from a bored housewife to a woman with a purpose. The author kept me guessing for the whole book! \n 'The Vanishing Year' has been called a \"domestic thriller\". This is a perfect description. It is an edgy, sexy, exciting story that kept me guessing until the very end. The little clues sprinkled here and there, the red herrings, the gorgeous Henry all added up to the perfect thriller for me! Don't miss this one. I can't wait to read more books by the amazing Kate Moretti. \n Favorite quote: \n \"It wasn't that long ago that I found this sort of convenient arrangement of our lives to be charming, like a party card trick. A sleight of hand here, a simple misdirection there, and Voila, here's your dinner.

Watch me . . . You'll see.\" \n In this smart and very engaging mystery, we're treated to three different perspectives on a crime that occurs very early on in the book. Hattie is a good girl, having grown up in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. She aches to break free and move to New York City after high school. Hattie is the perfect daughter, student, girlfriend and friend. \n But Hattie has a secret life, one that threatens the delicate balance of her small Minnesota farming town. She is merely pretending, acting a role, when the \"real\" Hattie is far from perfect. Her actions will affect and change many people's lives forever. Peter is her high school English teacher who feels trapped in a loveless marriage. And Del is the lead investigator on Hattie's brutal murder. His voice lends a dry wit and careful reason to the series of events unfolding around him. Can he be neutral when the families he has known his whole life are brutally affected by this unspeakable crime? \n \"Mom warned me that I had a lot to learn about the world. I wished she would've mentioned how much the learning was going to hurt.\" \n I was enthralled by this deeply moving thriller! The small-town atmosphere is perfectly captured by the author. Every characters is flawed, some more so than others. I never saw the ending coming. This book was fast-paced, smart and engaging. Don't be put off by the endless comparisons to other best-sellers in this genre. 'Everything You Want Me to Be' stands on its own as a poignant and suspenseful story. Highly recommended for all fans of psychological thrillers and murder mysteries! \n \"You can't live your life acting for other people. Other people will just use you up.

Alternating before and after a tragic accident, this book poses complex questions which are not always easily answered. \n As I read this compelling story, I found myself asking, \"What would I do if this happened to me?\" At first, I thought the answer was clear. But as Evelyn's journey reveals, we don't always do what's right. People can be selfish and self-centered. The world can sometimes be a gray place. \n Evelyn is the perfect wife and mother, devoted to her distant husband and her busy teenage son. But she has hidden her real self away for years, trying to be everything to everyone. She tries to please everyone but doesn't even realize it. The author has a very keen eye for suburban life: \n \"Her real purse was shoved under the passenger seat, stuffed full of receipts and Kleenex and hand sanitizer and Band-Aids and cough drops and an emergency flashlight and anything else that any person in the world might need from her while she was near. An eternal diaper bag for the eternal mother.\" \n Of course this is a thriller and not everything is at it seems on the surface. Evelyn flip-flops between acting on what she has witnessed and letting everything go back to way it was \"before.\" \n Evelyn had been so sure just a few minutes ago. Gary had to turn this woman in. He had to tell the truth. It was the only way to put this behind them and start over. Now she didn't know anything. \n Even though Evelyn does not behave in the most admirable way in the beginning of this story, I felt strongly sympathetic towards her and I found myself saying \"Yes! YES!\" to her during the course of this very readable book. Yes, there is cheating in this story, so if that is a hard limit for you, look away! But that theme was an integral part of this book and vital to Evelyn's growth. \n She'd spent her whole life doing the right thing. That could be someone else's job now. She was moving on. \n I could not put this book down! The synopsis intrigued me. And I loved the complete metamorphosis that Evelyn experienced. This book was at times tragic, funny, sexy and sarcastic. The author's musings on marriage were sharp and unwavering \n Jesus, how had she become this? Her life had been deep and rich and complex once. She'd lived with her single mother and her older sister, and they'd been strong, resilient, quick. She'd taken city buses and negotiated dangerous neighborhoods even as a child, and she'd imagined herself growing into an artist with wild, creative friends who had little money but so much heart. \n This was real page-turner, a mature story with mature themes and situations. I loved it!! The conclusion surprised me and was perfectly satisfying. Highly recommend! \n From now on, if something was important to her, she would demand it. Because the truth was that she belonged anywhere she wanted to be, and she was beautiful just for being brave.", "date_added": "Mon Oct 31 21:47:44 -0700 2016", "date_updated": "Fri Nov 11 14:23:26 -0800 2016", "read_at": "Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 -0800 2016", "started_at": "Sat Nov 05 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 8, "n_comments": 0}

'When All the Girls Have Gone' is intelligent, fast-paced and very creative. Max and Charlotte are very real and relatable characters. Loved the author's smart and snappy writing style!

She has legions of fans and I can see why. I adored Max, who is a man of few words but knows how to get the job done. He has a very painful past so his lovely romance with Charlotte seems all the more sweeter. Charlotte is a no-nonsense heroine, who finds herself working in a retirement home after making some big life changes. \n Charlotte's step-sister Jocelyn is traveling to a retreat. The two sisters are very close but Jocelyn has protected and sheltered Charlotte all of their lives. A mysterious package arrives at Jocelyn's home while she is away and Charlotte learns that Jocelyn's best friend Louise has died. Jocelyn is unreachable, since she is on a \"no technology\" retreat. \n Enter Max Cutler, who was already involved in the matter after being hired by a cousin of Louise's. Is Louise's sudden death related to Jocelyn's disappearance? The details begin to unfold in this delicious thriller. There are lots of shady characters and plenty of secrets. This is a quick, super-intriguing and twisty story that you can read in one day. I absolutely loved Max Cutler, with his smart, strong, quiet ways. He is my kind of hero! The romance is a quiet one but it fits perfectly with this story. There is tons of action and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading this book. \n Jayne Ann Krantz is a skilled writer and Max and Charlotte's story grabbed me from the very first page. There are lots of surprises in this one with some humor thrown in for good measure. Charlotte and Max are a little awkward, very lonely and absolutely perfect together! If you love a good mystery with a little romance and a smart and \"spunky\" heroine, then you'll love 'When All the Girls Have Gone.'

Cold, her kidnapper, actually saves her life by hiding her away once he realizes that she will be useless to his boss once a ransom is collected. \n There is much more to the story: there is the sad tale of James and Eve's marriage, the father's coldness toward Mia for most of her life, and the superstar sister who outshines Mia at every turn. The only one who seems to really care about her is her captor. \n Lots of readers didn't like the jumping back and forth in time in the narration but I felt it added a sense of disorientation which was necessary in the book.

Couldn't put it down!! Crisp, concise, fast-paced and enthralling. All of the ingredients for a great read! \n \"If you lie enough times, no one believes your truth.\" \n This book is Alessandra Torre at her best: no-nonsense, smart and engaging fiction. Helena is a very unlikely heroine, prickly, moody and basically angry at the world. She doesn't want to rely on anyone at all. She even keeps her long-time agent Kate at arm's length. \n \"On rare days, Kate regrets ever meeting the woman. But on most days, she just wonders about her. They say all geniuses are a little mad. Maybe Helena's madness just took longer to come out.\" \n But Helena as a story to tell and she doesn't have much time to do it. She sets her sights on one writer, and one writer only, to become her ghostwriter. A competing romance author, Marka writes books that Helena actually despises. But she sees a talent there that would be perfect for her own story. \n \"What's happened to me? I have a story that I don't have time to tell. I have an empty house that reeks of death. I have no friends, no family, and no one to ask for help. I'm dying, and it's the best thing that has happened to me in a long time.\" \n Alessandra Torre builds the suspense perfectly in this book, all while holding the reader's attention and slowly revealing the terrible secret about Helena's life. This book is also a fascinating glimpse into the lonely life of a writer and the almost obsessive need to get the words out at all costs. \n \"You can tell them who you are, or what your job in the book was. I don't mind if they know I've had help.\" \n They. The gods in their world, the eyes on which the axis rotated. The readers. The critics. What would they think? \n This is most definitely not a romance but the main characters are both renowned romance writers. Helena's own story begins as a romance but you just know it is NOT going to conclude with a happily ever after. \n \"Boys like him don't go for girls like me, they don't follow me with their eyes, or listen when I speak. They don't lean closer or want more.\" \n I absolutely loved this book. Once I started I could not put it down. I applaud the author for creating a heroine who is far from loveable yet completely and utterly captivating. No question that astute readers will figure out the terrible secret before the surprising conclusion, but this book is a total winner nonetheless. It is completely original and inventive.

I went back and re-read the first chapter of this book after I finished to get a better picture of the sudden and violent kidnapping that occurs at the very beginning of this book. \n \"My life is great. It's just not exceptional. And there was a time when it could have been.\" \n \"You killed your ambition, didn't you?\" \n \"It died of natural causes. Of neglect.\" \n Jason is literally snatched from his current life and ends up in a place that might be a dream. He can't tell the difference between real-life and fantasy, until it slowly starts to dawn on him what is really happening to him. The author made me feel sad, nostalgic and thrilled all at once. Plus there is an ethical dilemma at the heart of this story. \n \"I feel insanity stalking me again, threatening to curl me up fetal and shatter me into a million pieces.\" \n Dark Matter is best read without knowing any spoilers. AND I was thrilled to learn that it is going to be made into a movie!! YES!! Paging Viggo Mortensen or Michael Fassbender! This story literally had me on the edge of seat the entire time I was reading. Just when I thought I had things figured out, I was surprised and thrilled by the next turn of events. Part philosophy about what might have been, part romance, and all suspense, Dark Matter is a book I won't soon forget. \n \"It's the beautiful thing about youth. \n There's a weightlessness that permeates everything because no damning choices have been made, no paths committed to, and the road forking out ahead is pure, unlimited potential.\" \n (With thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for a review copy.)", "date_added": "Sun Aug 28 20:43:49 -0700 2016", "date_updated": "Sat Sep 03 06:59:39 -0700 2016", "read_at": "Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "started_at": "Sun Aug 28 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 13, "n_comments": 0}

Moody, evocative and thrilling, Lisa Jewell's writing surprised and enthralled me from beginning to end. \n This book begins with Alice, a frazzled single mother living in a tiny seaside town in England, finding a man, lost and alone and with no memory of how he came to be sitting on the beach in the driving rain. \n Alice is funny, warm, witty and has not made the best choices in her life. In fact, her love life stinks so she is very wary of men in general. But something calls to her about this lost and confused man, and she brings him back to her cottage to recuperate in her guest house. \n \"How long have you been sitting out here?\" \n \"I got here yesterday.\" \n \"Where did you come from?\" \n \"I have no idea.\" \n This brilliant story is told from multiple POV's spanning several decades. At the same time that Alice finds \"Frank\" (her nickname for the seemingly lovely man struggling with his memory loss), a young bride in London named Lily realizes her new husband has suddenly vanished. She is new to England and does not know anyone at all. The mystery of her missing newlywed husband is one of the driving forces of this gem of a book. \n There are tons of twists and surprises in store for the reader. We do not know how the characters in this story are connected... or even if they are connected at all. \n Flashing back decades before, young Gray and Kirsty are on holiday with their parents. Their fascinating story involves a local man who becomes interested in Kirsty. Their stories rocket towards a stunning conclusion with Alice, Frank and Lily. To say that I could not put this book down is an understatement! From the bustling London setting to the small seaside resort town, 'I Found You' sets the bar for romantic suspense books this year. \n Long after finishing this book, I still can't stop thinking about the characters. Lisa Jewell is a new favorite author of mine. This was my first book by her and now I cannot wait to get to her other titles. Alice was completely relatable, even when she didn't make the wisest of choices. \n I can't recommend this book highly enough! I loved every word. \n ARC provided via NetGalley.", "date_added": "Tue Aug 16 18:24:22 -0700 2016", "date_updated": "Fri Apr 28 12:21:45 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Thu Apr 20 10:28:22 -0700 2017", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 9, "n_comments": 3}

But that's often just a convenient rationalization to explain away a moment of moral failure-- of weakness. We can control ourselves.\" \n UNDONE is a weird, wild, thought-provoking and very witty story. It is part erotic thriller, part suspense and all satire. I finished this book a few weeks ago and had to think about the story for a while. This is a very risky book that is certainly not for everyone but is a fascinating commentary on society's obsession with celebrity and fame. UNDONE centers around Dez, a dangerous predator who is living with his former student, Chloe. Dez has a sick obsession with teenage girls, but totally rationalizes his unhealthy attraction and blames everyone else for his problems. He is smart but very, very troubled and borders on sociopathic. He ha convinced himself that his relationship with the teenage Chloe is almost normal. \n \"But on a deeper level, shielded, hidden, he recognized some profound connection between them. He felt an almost frightening reliance on her, an emotional dependence. The feeling was unprecedented for him and brought him a form of happiness.\" \n Dez becomes obsessed with Jasper, a famous author who has written a best-selling book about his family. Dez creates a diabolical scheme to destroy Jasper, enlisting the gullible Chloe in his plan. So begins a suspenseful story that literally rockets along to a stunning conclusion, filled with biting commentary, completely inappropriate characters and very, very taboo subjects. \n There is no question that John Colapinto is a brilliant writer and his prose and plot are flawless. BUT this book is NOT for the faint of heart or anyone who is offended by forbidden subjects! If you are looking for a standard romantic suspense novel, move along, because UNDONE is not for you. But if you love to read something different, incredibly creative and very challenging, then this is the book for you. Kudos to John Colapinto for tackling some very dangerous themes in an incredibly creative way. I found UNDONE to be enormously readable and I encourage anyone who loves something different to give this book a try. \n On another note, I find it incredible that the author received over 40 rejection letters for this book! It is in no way the most taboo book I have ever read and I am glad that the publisher gave this book a chance. \n (Copy gifted by the author in return for an honest review.)", "date_added": "Fri Apr 08 00:25:29 -0700 2016", "date_updated": "Thu May 26 23:16:32 -0700 2016", "read_at": "Sun May 22 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "started_at": "Tue May 17 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 9, "n_comments": 1}

What a fascinating, twisty, surprising story!! I love KA Tucker's writing so I was very excited to read this one and it is VERY different from her other books. Adult, suspenseful, thrilling...with an ending that I never saw coming! This is one of those books that you will not put down until you are finished. It is told in flashbacks and in alternating POV's from Maggie and her best friend Celine's diary entries. Maggie does not believe her best friend committed suicide and begins investigating the circumstances surrounding Celine's death in New York City. She meets is all of the important people in Celine's life, including Jace, who may or may not be hiding something. There is also Grady, the very sexy building super, who is also under suspicion in Maggie's eyes. \n I gingerly unfold the paper that's obviously been handled many times, judging by the crinkles in it. \n My eyes widen. \n A naked man fills one side. He's entrancingly handsome... lying on his back, one muscular arm disappearing into the pillow beneath his head, a white sheet tangled around his legs, not quite covering the goods... \n Who the hell is this guy and why didn't I ever hear about him? And where is he now? Where were they together last? \n Does he know that she's dead? \n ... I slowly fold the paper back up. Celine's cursive scrawl decorates the back side in purple ink. Words I hadn't noticed before. \n Words that make my heart stop now. \n 'This man was once my salvation. Now he will be my ruin.' \n Maggie and Celine were childhood friends but grew apart once they got older. Maggie learns many things about Celine's life through reading her diaries and is convinced that the diaries will be the key to learning about her death. He Will Be my Ruin is a tightly written, taught suspense thriller that has a completely resolved ending and a smart, resourceful heroine.

Weird, I know), I was thrilled that there was more to this story. \n As funny as the author's commentary on NYC life was, she is even funnier and more on-point with her look at living in L.A. Don't fear, Joe is still as crazy as ever, but in an almost \"Being There\" fashion, everyone around him seems to mold him into what they believe him to be. \n And Joe is trying. He really is.

But everyone is just so phony and materialistic and so Joe really believes he is justified in his actions.

There are actually several points of view in 'The Girl on the Train' but Rachel is the main narrator. A sad sack of a woman, she has been recently divorced, fired from her job in London and is losing a nasty battle with the bottle. Because she is often drunk, nothing she says or recalls is trustworthy. \n I needed a break from my usual contemporary romances and this thriller kept me glued to my Kindle! Rachel sees a \"perfect couple\" from the train every day, and she concocts an elaborate fantasy life for them. Surely they must lead a perfect life! Unlike her, they seem to live a charmed life, sitting in their pretty garden every day, sipping coffee together. \n \"I don't know their names, either, so I had to name them myself. Jason, because he's handsome in a British film star kind of way, not a Depp or a Pitt, but a Firth, or a Jason Isaacs. And Jess just goes with Jason, and it goes with her. It fits her, pretty and carefree as she is. They're a match, they're a set. They're happy, I can tell. They're what I used to be, they're Tom and me five years ago. They're what I lost, they're everything I want to be. \n Slowly we realize that in fact NOTHING in this book is as it seems, and Rachel is soon drawn into a frightening situation about which, sadly for her, she has no memory. On top of everything else, Rachel is constantly morose and sad, depressed about the loss of her beloved husband Tom, and begins to drive everyone away who ever cared about her. \n \"Beautiful sunshine, cloudless skies, no one to play with, nothing to do. Living like this, the way I'm living at the moment, is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight, so little cover of darkness, when everyone is out and about, being flagrantly, aggressively happy. It's exhausting, and it makes you feel bad if you're not joining in. \n Rachel drinks so much that she begins to black out. She stalks her ex-husband and his new wife Anna but just can't seem to stop herself. \n \"I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.\" \n This book takes many twists and turns and nothing at all is at it seems. Just when I thought I knew where the story was going, it veered off into another place entirely. it is smart, perfectly paced and filled with flawed, all-too-human characters.

I love dark reads and this sounded exactly like a story I would love. Remember if you are looking for a book about love and romance, this is not the story for you. Deanna is a sex \"web cam\" girl but is also a virgin. She locks herself away in her apartment with virtually no human interaction beyond her online interactions because she battles homicidal tendencies. She has her neighbor actually lock her in her own apartment at night so that she won't be able to give in to her urges. \n A deliveryman becomes fascinated with this beautiful and strange girl who won't even open the door to retrieve her packages and Deanna and Jeremy begin a very strange but exciting relationship. Just when I though this book was going a certain way, it changed course and went down a completely different path. I was shocked, thrilled, fascinated and blown away by the ending of this book. \n \"No one is normal. Everyone is just pretending to be normal.\" \n I absolutely loved how this story unfolded layer by layer. I was immediately pulled into this incredible story, and was fascinated by all of the characters, by some of their very dark natures, and by the interactions and internal dialogue that goes on inside Deanna's head. The setting and the thrilling storyline that unfolds stunned me and I felt compelled to know more.This book is a must-read, especially for fans of dark stories. There is plenty of sex, and even a little romance thrown in, but it is the shock and surprise at the characters and the story that make this an unforgettable book. \n I want to thank the author for not only making unsympathetic characters believable, but for also writing this book that I will never forget. \n (*Copy provided by the author for an honest review.)", "date_added": "Thu Jul 10 05:53:58 -0700 2014", "date_updated": "Mon Sep 08 03:16:16 -0700 2014", "read_at": "", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

DO NOT DISTURB is a thrilling, dark, sexy and fast-paced story with a twist! If you are looking for a dark, smart and erotic story, then DO NOT DISTURB is the book for you. \n This book is the sequel to THE GIRL IN 6E, a fantastic and surprising story which I recommend that you read immediately!! The author continues the story of Deanna in DO NOT DISTURB and her story is intertwined with another character who might, just might, be as dark and disturbed as she is. But where Deanna tries her best to keep her dark nature hidden away and under control (barely), this new character does not. He is plain evil. The author has done a masterful job at building suspense and anticipation in this book and the plot twists are fantastic. This is a smart and twisted book and definitely NOT for the faint of heart. \n Deanna is faced with danger here in the form of an unhappy client. Will he outsmart the brilliant Deanna and pierce the layers of protection she has built of around her? Will Deanna finally find some semblance of normalcy with the sexy and understanding Jeremy? Once again, the author writes a brilliant story that answers all these questions without talking down to the reader and without coming to any false conclusions. The tensions are high and the sexy times are brilliantly erotic. I haven't stopped thinking about these characters! I amy dying (well, not literally) for another book in this series!!

This is a f*d-up love story, to say the least. You might think you've heard that before, but honestly, you have never read a story like PUSH before. I won't go into detail about the plot because this book is best read without knowing too much about the storyline. Going in blind to this book is so much more thrilling! \n Emma is moving on from her past and horrible stepfather and two brothers who were manipulated by him. She's had a rough life. She is starting over on her own, which is very freeing for her. She meets David they day she moves into her in apartment. He is the handyman for the building and was \"sent\" by the owner to fix her kitchen, which is a mess. She opens her door hesitantly, unsure of whether he's telling the truth or whether he is just a psycho. My anxiety attack began when she opened the door. You will need tranquilizers for this story!! It does end with a cliffhanger and I told myself, \"No! It can't end like this!\" But PUSH is so well-written that it is like a breath of fresh air.

Her style is powerful, clean, bold and unapologetic. Mud Vein is no exception. Senna and Isaac's story is not what you think, and not at all what you would you expect. This book totally took me off guard because I didn't read any reviews with spoilers in them. Like her earlier books (The Love Me with Lies series), this story is brutally honest, and is not a hearts-and-flowers, sugary-sweet romance. \n The plot is incredibly inventive and different, and stunning as well. I fell in love with Isaac and by the end of the book, also really cared about Senna even though as with other characters written by Ms. Fisher, she is a prickly sort. I did not see the ending of this book coming, and it is really best if you don't know the ending as well. Mud Vein is another incredibly written book by Tarryn Fisher.

To me, that is the hallmark of an excellent book. Here is the synopsis of the story, in which a woman wakes to find a dangerous stranger in her bed: \n \"Now your home has become your prison, and your body, a battlefield. How would you hold onto your sanity, your self-esteem, your very soul against someone determined to annihilate all three? \n In the psychological thriller Break Her, one woman will find herself in this almost unthinkable situation, and one man will discover that he has finally come up against someone unlike any of those he has destroyed before. \n On the surface, this intruder has all the advantages: strength, weapons, ruthlessness. The only way he can lose is if he finds himself responding to his victim on a human level. The only way she can win is if she rips away the protective lies she's told herself, the hard shell of indifference she's hidden in, and becomes again what she has not been since she lost everything that mattered to her, years ago. \" \n Break Her is a very graphic story of the gripping psychological interplay between the woman and the rapist. (I refuse to call her simply \"Victim\" as some reviewers have done.) The rapist is very cunning and very strong. He is determined to destroy the woman not only physically, but emotionally as well. \n \"He was decent looking. He probably had money. He could have sex any way he wanted any time he wanted. But he liked it this way.\" \n The story itself is set over a period of an excruciating day and a half, within the physical confines of a house. The characters are not named by the author. Through a series of flashbacks, however, the woman's past is explained in detail and other characters are introduced. I was hanging on every word, and reading furiously to reach the stunning conclusion of this book. \n \"You think you'll wear me out,\" he hissed, not using a question. \"You think you'll eventually satisfy me, and reach the end of this. But everything you do makes me want you more, deeper, impossibly more. I think I'm reaching a point I've never hit before. Like perpetual motion. Or nirvana. I'll never stop.\" \n There are many questions raised by this story. What was the author trying to convey here? Well, first and foremost, I think it is a story of the woman's fierce strength and will to survive. The author has written this book under a pseudonym so that we do not know the writer's gender. Brilliant. \n The author has ventured an opinion on the subject of rape in other forums that forgiveness allows rape victims to move on, and to separate themselves from what happened. The author has also questioned why rape is the only crime that seems to be an \"open wound\", which gives men a huge amount of power to know that by this one act, they can potentially destroy a woman. Certainly the woman in \"Break Her\" does not accept the definition of rape as an \"open wound\" and in that sense, this book is very empowering. \n \"Break Her\" is an incredibly gripping and yes, emotionally exhausting, story. It is very thought-provoking and will make you question what values you believe in. I could not put this book down. I can only hope that the author chooses to continue the woman's story because I need more of this story.Break HerB.G.

The relationships crafted between the narrator and the women in his life are beautiful, unique and shape the world in which he exists. \n I'm not sure what more I can say without going into greater specifics that I fear would give away too much of this book. All I can say is it's beautifully written, it pulls you in, and despite revolving around a violent crime, you're more focused on the relationships and the hope of healing of all the characters.

That said, there are some problems with this book. The sentence structure is awkward in much of the book. OK, no one reads erotica for great literature but this could do with an editor who understands grammar and sentence structure. It's not horrible but it's awkward and that would be an easy fix. What happened to editors anyway? They don't seem to exist anymore. \n There was something that irked me at the beginning but thankfully it was never repeated. Pre-mortem. No. That is not a word. Postmortem. Antemortem. Perimortem. A cop should know this and I hope if the author does an edit of this book that he fixes that one, it's right in the beginning and it really made me cringe. This is the trouble that I think any writer would encounter who doesn't have the resources to speak directly with a police officer or homicide detective in order to research their book and keep it realistic. There are some problems here as well. The biggest one (and I promise to not give any spoilers) is how obvious the killer is and how determined Gavin is to ignore it. I mean, neon flashing sign, obvious. But Gavin doesn't seem to have any cop instincts for a seasoned detective. This bothered me a lot and it made the book frustrating. That and well the whole set up because in the real world his insertion of himself into the case would really hinder any prosecution if/when an arrest was made. Due to his personal involvement with the club/people in the case, it would make any of his testimony highly suspect and would likely get him fired or at least busted down from detective. \n Like I said, however, I really did enjoy this book. Gavin and Ben are extremely likeable characters (even if Gavin does come across as a bit of a dummy). I really enjoyed Gavin's family and especially his brother Cole. AJ Rose has done a lot of things right here and it makes up for the problems even if I was yelling \"Why are you being so stupid?!\" at the book at one point. But I wanted to keep reading and that's the key and that's why I gave this 4 stars. I wanted to know how it would end. I wanted to cheer Ben and Gavin on in their relationship. I think AJ Rose has done a wonderful job with that part of the book and with opening the door to the BDSM world for any readers who may be unfamiliar with it. \n The sex scenes are explicit and steamy (and let's be honest, that's why you're considering reading this book). The awkward sentence structure is not a deterrent but the not very good at his job detective might be. If you're a fan of this genre and want a quick and easy read and are willing to suspend your disbelief that Gavin is any kind of cop, give it a shot. If you're looking for substance and literature or a good crime story, maybe give this one a miss. \n Warning, for those who may require it, there are some non-consensual violent acts in this book. You're reading an erotic story but it's also a crime story and you should keep that in mind. Also, of course, contains elements of BDSM. Why are you even considering reading a book with a photo of a guy tied up on the cover if you're bothered by kink? ;)", "date_added": "Thu Mar 05 12:14:46 -0800 2015", "date_updated": "Sat Mar 07 09:15:46 -0800 2015", "read_at": "Wed Mar 04 00:00:00 -0800 2015", "started_at": "Tue Mar 03 00:00:00 -0800 2015", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

It's definitely not erotica as the sex scenes are not that much different from what you might find in a Stephen King or James Patterson novel.

I'd figured out the \"who done it\" almost immediately but given that I usually do, that wasn't such a big deal. \n I would have loved to have the relationship between the protagonist and the antagonist explored further but I see this is a #1 so I'm anxious to read the next in the series and see if it continues and maybe gets a little more detailed. I hope so because this author created some really interesting characters. I also liked that nowhere in this story did things turn sweet and sappy. \n All too often lately I've found I'm reading books (even the ones that are published professionally) full of spelling and grammatical errors and though I think I did notice one or two this book doesn't seem to have suffered that same fate and that alone was refreshing! \n I definitely enjoyed the exploration of D/s while the characters remained true to what the author had first presented us.

Herron even alludes to the movie as Louisa (I think) stands on the roof of the skyscraper with a quipping villain. Anything that plays with Die Hard is good by me.

It becomes increasingly tense and violent and ends with Lee beating Cathy within an inch of her life and leaving her for dead. \n The other side of the narrative takes up Cathy's story about three years later: Lee has been in prison, Cathy has moved to London to disappear, and she has been dealing with the mental trauma--PTSD and OCD--of surviving such an attack. \n What Haynes does so beautifully is give us pieces from the \"past\" of Cathy's story, as it move forward in time and the reader is more and more terrified along with our protagonist, alternated with pieces from the \"present\" of Cathy's story, as she works on the skills to help her cope with the past and feel more in control. As the reader is on the edge of her seat leading up to the \"past\" climax, the current Cathy is getting better and better, which turns out to be necessary for Lee's final attack. \n The story isn't so much about an abusive man as it is about a strong woman who is abandoned by her friends but continues to trust people and get the help she needs. It is a book written by a woman and never makes Cathy out to be pathetic for staying with Lee; she is never an idiot, nor is she unbelievable. She is a normal, smart, independent woman; she could be any of us, and that's what makes it even scarier. \n On a side note, I love Karen Cass as the narrator and will make a point to listen to more books read by her.

Now, I have nothing against time traveling houses (way cool), but I just wasn't as scared of or horrified by Harper as I was of Clayton. \n I also really enjoyed that Broken Monsters has protagonists--Gabriella and Layla--who are women of color. It's not something I see often in the horror or thriller genres, but it's something I'd like to see more of. Additionally, the regular horror of what a group of teenage boys does to Layla's friend Cass is almost as awful as the murders Clayton commits--it certainly had me yelling at the book.

Now, I don't mind that they're powerless. In fact it's this very powerlessness makes it a true tale of horror alongside stories like Rosemary's Baby and The Lady Vanishes where the female characters are manipulated, psychologically tortured, betrayed, and made to think that they are crazy. I love stories like this; I find them to be much more terrifying than stories of ghosts or monsters (although yes, Rosemary's Baby is a monster story, but that's not what makes it so scary). But, because The Woman in White is a product of its time, the women cannot overcome their situation or their nemesis alone. They must use a man--albeit a man who we as readers are rooting for--to do the work for them. \n Even Marion, who is a strong and independent female character and easily the heroine of Collins's story, is only allowed to live because of Count Fosco. He admires her (and loves her) so that he helps her to live when she comes down with fever and tuberculosis. He reads her diary and makes notes about, essentially, how *cute* it is. And it is Fosco who ultimately holds the power to confess his deeds in writing and give Marion's sister Laura her identity back. \n And then we realize that Laura wouldn't have even inherited Limmeridge House if she'd not had a male child. (And did anyone notice that as soon as Walter and Laura get married he almost exclusively refers to her as \"my wife\" instead of using her name? Come on, Walt.) \n Now, none of this is surprising given the book's historical context. But it's still irritating. Yes, I enjoyed the book; it's well written, well narrated (Bailey and Prebble are great), and a solid mystery.

By layering more information about Tracy, and the very important clue about her contacting Chloe, Gran is building a character, a single mystery, and a rich series of books inching satisfyingly toward a payoff. \n Now, do I really think that Gran will let Claire die before we figure out the truth about Tracy's disappearance?

Again, I beg the question, why did I finish this book? \n I think it's because I kept hoping that it would get better--that the massacre of an entire village of people that begins the story would come back in thrilleresque detail. But that never happens. Mankell tells a story that is much, much too complicated for a single book, and never tense or dramatic. Could it have been a trilogy? Sure, why not? Then he could have really explored the political aspects that take up so much of the plot but never quite feel connected to the massacre. It's not quite a political thriller, and it's not quite a murder/serial killer mystery, and it's not quite a tale of historically motivated revenge.

And I was pleasantly surprised. \n The story and the character of Walter Sherman are much more serious than the t.v. producers gave them credit for, which is a shame. They turned the idea into a caricature and reduced Sherman's age (and thus his maturity) by about 25 years. His older, better, book version--while certainly not as appealing to an 18 - 35 year old t.v. audience--is certainly more interesting. \n The story is not a who-done-it or even a why'd-he-do-it, but a smart and slowly paced thriller involving big agriculture, Wall Street greed, and a lot of loss, both of the financial and the human kind. The characters are interesting, the story is nicely complex, and the bad guys are just who you'd want them to be (and they get just what they should in the end). \n Marc Vietor does a very nice job reading this, too.

Of course we're on Team Paul. \n But then the onion starts to peel and we realize that Paul's not a terrifically reliable narrator, and there's a lot more going on here than it first seemed. With each detail and anecdote, I became more and more uncomfortable, and I loved it. These characters are all playing a game, and it's really only Serge -- our unlikable brother -- who is straightforward. Sort of. \n I could have done without the biological sub-plot: Paul's illness and the subsequent curiosity about whether or not Claire got an amniocentesis.

But it's as though she had this great idea for a really interesting thriller told using an innovative narrative style, but then she didn't know how to finish it. So, about halfway through the book, it turns into a Lifetime movie. And the really, really corny Lifetime movie. Not the one starring Kathy Bates or Shirley MacClaine, but the one starring that one actress you saw in that one episode of Melrose Place in 1997. \n One of the book club babes made the argument that the book was about the bubble that bursts in a relationship when you realize that both people are being untruthful about who they really are. And yes, there are certainly elements of that.

The characters living in the Kavach building (or at least the ones we're introduced to; I don't agree with Clines's decision to add more names of residents we haven't met.

The Kavach building is certainly a mystery to be solved, but I had no clue as to what was waiting for me on the other side of room 14.

Clines has a nice complexity without being overly contrived, and it's clear from the beginning that he knows exactly where he is (and you are) going, even if you don't have a clue.

The story of Chris Harper's murder is approached from the present, with Moran and his \"partner\" DI Conway, and Moran is narrating first person as he and Conway tread though the lies upon lies told by two packs of teenage boarding school students. \n And while Moran and Conway move backwards to retrace what happened and solve Chris's murder, the other side of the narration is moving forward from months before the murder happened. This approach uses a third person point-of-view that dips into each of the minds of the main players in this drama, a quartet of best friends: Holly, Julia, Selena, and Rebecca. \n As usual, French's prose is rich and paints a beautiful setting for the characters to navigate. And, as usual, the setting is essential to the conflict. I really enjoyed this story, especially the new narrative style and subject matter French is playing with.

There are two things that made this, for me, better than expected: first, there was a great introduction by historian Norman Stone, which gave the story, and Ambler, quite a bit of interesting context. Second, the majority of the book takes place on a ship that is traveling from Istanbul to Genoa, Italy, and I do love books that are confined to boats, trains, or planes. There's something immediately romantic, civilized, and terrifying about a setting where it's possible to drink a martini and play a hand of bridge after dinner, and then get murdered in your cabin while the other passengers are sleeping peacefully. \n My only complaint about this book is that Ambler sets up an element of setting on the ship that I thought was going to be very important in the plot, but it turned out to be just a minor way to get to know two of the characters. He makes the walls between the cabins paper-thin so that Graham, our hero, can hear everything his French neighbors--Mme. and M. Mathis--say in the adjoining room. I kept waiting for these thin walls to play a larger part, since the characters referenced them a number of times in more serious situations. But they never do. \n Otherwise, the audiobook narrator, David Thorpe, did an excellent job of creating voices for many characters from many countries, and I actually could have listened to him for quite a bit longer.

I'd also like to be a detective just like Claire. She's pretty terrific: a snarky, obsessive, emotionally closed off quasi-lush who takes any drug that's offered to her and rarely has an un-ironic thing to say. But she's unbelievably likeable. The story itself is a bitter love letter to New Orleans. The post-storm world that Gran leads us through is dilapidated, sad, and poor, though many pockets are still rich and alive with color and history. The characters each have their own specific survival stories, which makes this a mystery both of the hurricane as well as of the murder Claire has come back to New Orleans to solve. In fact, the survival aspect of the story is frequently more interesting than the murder. \n Gran creates a strong sense of noir through the book, and it works so nicely with this modern story. Claire DeWitt and the world she's in are hard-boiled, but never in a false way. I am curious, though, to see if the next book (I'm assuming [hoping] there will be at least one more Claire DeWitt mystery) can work in the same atmosphere-rich noir way in a different location. DeWitt lives in San Francisco but grew up in Brooklyn, the city of her biggest personal mystery, so it makes sense she'd go there next. But New York might be too easy; I'd like to see her somewhere stranger. Like Omaha or Detroit. \n The story is told first person, which I don't always like but is successful here. Carol Monda, the audiobook narrator, is hard voiced and perfectly cast for this story and this narrator. I did have a minor issue with her reading of some of the teenaged boys in the book (there are a lot)--the adolescent voice mixed with the Southern accent didn't always feel true, but ultimately I didn't mind it.

The story straddles two time periods and a few cities: Oslo, 2000 and Leningrad & Vienna, 1944. It took me a while to really catch onto the heart of the story, which might have had to do with the fact that I listened to this instead of reading it and, as a result, occasionally missed the date/chapter transitions and character names while I was navigating traffic. It also might have had to do with the half dozen Norwegian soldiers Nesbo introduces us to within the first few chapters--I kept forgetting who was who (which, actually, might have been the point). \n I didn't know much about Norway's role in World War II, so I found this element of the plot very interesting. Nesbo was able to work in the history and its effect on contemporary Norway while keeping my interest and the integrity of the plot. Actually, it elevated and complicated the plot. He created great parallels between the eras as well as a realistic and sympathetic sense of cause and effect. The characters were fairly well drawn and believable--though I'm sure I'd have gotten more into the book and the characters if I'd started with the first Harry Hole book instead of this, the third (but the first and second weren't available on Audible, so I did what I had to do). \n There was a moment near the end when I was certain that Nesbo had jumped the shark, and although he sort of recovered, it was still an odd, out-of-nowhere, obvious red herring. Although, by the end, there were bits that I hadn't quite figured out, so I guess the mystery remained intact until the reveal. But I still didn't like it. \n A note on the narrator, Robin Sachs: not only did he have a nice deep, soothing mystery narrator's voice, but his accents were spot-on--he had to do some Viennese and some German, and each was natural. Also, his transitions among the characters and his take on female voices were all perfect--just a subtle lowering or softening of the voice and I knew who was who. Just great. (and I'm especially sensitive to this because the book I'm currently listening to has a less than stellar American narrator whose English accent is something out of a high school production of Noel Coward.) So if you're considering listening to this, certainly do.

Lelic keeps all aspects of this book balanced: it's a police procedural with a very likable lead detective, a psychological and behavioral analysis, and an oral history all wrapped up. \n Lucia reminds me a bit of a greener version of Barry Maitland's Kathy Kolla. Her experiences in the precinct echo those of Samuel's, and although the parallels are obvious, they're no less frightening. And the narrative style--third person for Lucia's experiences and first person accounts, interview style, from the witnesses of the shooting--is the perfect narrative tool to unravel the mystery (and the cast of narrators for the audiobook are spot-on and great to listen to). \n I could have lived without the Harry love interest ending--Lucia's strength should have stood on its own. And I also could have also done with more about the truly innocent victims of Samuel's shooting. The children and teacher who, for lack of a better phrase, \"got in his way,\" were a bit minimized for my comfort since, at the end, I felt that Samuel was a fully sympathetic character and wanted to shoot Dom and Travis myself.

It was odd to read an Archie and Susan book without Gretchen Lowell (though she makes a brief appearance at the end), but Cain fills up the Beauty Killer-shaped hole with new and likable (and new and creepy) characters. \n My only fault with this was the narrator. She \"did\" a lot of the voices using way too affected accents and timbres, and her interpretations frequently didn't meet the voice I'd already created in my head after reading three previous books with the same characters.

And true to the \"performance,\" Berman was frequently a bit of a ham. It made some of Hill's cheesier dialogue even cheesier. But I got used to rolling my eyes and by the end of it I was okay with the reading. \n Now, I'd had this on my to-read shelf for a bit but inched it up once I found out from the Neil Gaiman interview with Stephen King (a really nice interview) that Hill is King's son. I think that even if I'd not known that I would have noticed the similarities in their styles, especially the way both writers overuse pop culture references (mostly musical) and the aforementioned cheesy dialogue. But I can't say that I didn't enjoy it, and don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of King. But he's not a perfect writer and neither is his son. But Hill has written a supernatural mystery crossed with a revenge story, and both are pretty successful. \n My biggest beef is with the reason Lee Tourneau is impervious to Ig's horns at the start. The reason Hill gives is that Merrin's cross, which eventually becomes something Ig, himself, uses to hide his horns from others, has a kind of magic. But it would have been so much more interesting if Hill had gone with the more simple, logical, and real explanation: Lee doesn't react to the horns because Lee has no guilt. He's a textbook sociopath, free of a conscience. The devil's horns can't elicit something that is simply nonexistent. I think that in this setting and in this story a sociopath makes a really interesting character (and one I'd have liked explored just a bit further). But Hill didn't use the sociopathy for its obvious implications, and that disappointed me. \n I also could have done without the \"treehouse of the mind.\" It felt a bit unnecessary, needlessly complicated. But Hill's take on and exploration of the devil and evil is original and interesting, so I was okay with some of my minor issues.", "date_added": "Sun Feb 21 09:06:35 -0800 2010", "date_updated": "Mon Jul 16 16:04:24 -0700 2012", "read_at": "Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 -0700 2012", "started_at": "Tue Jul 03 00:00:00 -0700 2012", "n_votes": 1, "n_comments": 0}

It could have been really solid. It's got a tense plot and an excellent sub-plot with a courtroom drama element, which I adore. There are some nice twists and the last line is actually quite terrific. However, it's full of trite dialogue and descriptions (and how many different ways can Coben have his narrator, Paul, describe the feeling of his heart being broken/torn/lurched about? Let's try One Million Times). \n Coben also goes way, way, WAY overboard with the pop-culture music references. He fits in Counting Crows, Ben Folds Five, and Bruce Springstein, among others. He also mentions a bunch of films as his characters \"take things\" from their plots and stories. Oy. And I don't say \"oy\" very often. In fact, I never say it. But Coben's references already feel way dated and I can't imagine how dumb it will read in another decade. Also, it's really irritating to get an allusion to a pop song rather than a really lush or real description of feeling. It got tedious. Very. Quickly. \n Also, nearly every woman in the book is breathtakingly gorgeous. Christ. Why does every woman need to be extraordinarily beautiful? Especially the minor characters! There's a coroner who's so drop-dead gorgeous (yes, that pun is intentional) that all the cops are oogling her during the crime scene investigation, and then all she does is have one more small scene where she discovers a bone. And THAT'S IT. So why did we get an entire paragraph (about two solid minutes of narration) devoted to her hotness? I don't know. I think that Coben suffers from DanBrownitis: heaping on enough unnecessary details throughout the novel to make Chekhov's Gun turn over in its literary grave. \n And to top it all off, this audiobook was narrated by Scott Brick, who also narrated Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? In the Dick novel, Brick's halting narrative technique fits; it's a distopic reality filled with androids and android bounty hunters. His weird, nasal voice and Shatneresque delivery fit quite perfectly. BUT, in a straight-forward thriller, it does not work at all. It is also laughable when he does \"accents\": New Jersey Cop, New Jersey Jew, Latino Couple, Russian Gangster, Other Russian Gangster. There was one section of third-person narration--not dialogue-- where I swear that he actually worked in the hint of an accent. That is not necessary and just downright idiotic. \n Had I read the novel rather than listen to it, I might not have had such issues. But I actually sighed, yelled, and laughed at various moments during Brick's narration, something I haven't done since The Road audiobook and its moronic narration (yes, I know it's supposed to be brilliant. I'll give it another shot and read it the old fashioned way). \n I know this is a long review and I apologize. But it was such an irritating book. I should have just stopped listening, but after an hour or so I chalked my irritation up to the narration and tried to get over it (unsuccessfully) and then I got hooked by this great sub-plot, and then I was too far into the mystery to not find out what happened.

In this novel, the characters writing the narratives are doing so to try to figure out the mysterious disappearance of the Moonstone, a gigantic Indian diamond stolen by a British military captain. The narrators are terrific; each takes on a distinctly different voice, and Collins does a brilliant job of writing each first-person account as not only an entry in the mystery, but also a detailed character exploration. The reader, Peter Jeffrey, is wonderful. He develops distinct, perfectly suited voices for each of the writers. And he does something I really appreciate: he doesn't do a \"woman\" voice for our only female writer, Clack (Drusilla Clack, a kooky religious spinster), he just gives a pompous and elitist voice, which is her to a \"t\". \n I'd recommend this book, though not for listening on traffic-heavy, rainy afternoons.

The prose, while not particularly great, is solidly okay--clean and simple--and this also keeps the eyes moving quickly (although, FYI Barclay: no one in the states refers to drunk people as being \"pissed,\" nor do many use the term \"bum\" to refer to a behind). It's a terrifying premise (I'd imagine especially for parents), but Barclay mucks about with a lot of twists, one of which is absolutely--ABSOLUTELY--unnecessary. Also, he's got a huge, glaring, flamboyant Chekhov's Gun: the moose. This is not a spoiler, and will only make your life easier. Don't mind the moose. Enough said. \n Barclay also does something I tell my creative writing students not to do, which is write this line: \"A solitary tear ran down her left cheek\" (398). I tell them to avoid this because solitary tears appear only in mediocre books and movies. Hmm. This actually applies to FTW in more ways than one, since by page 50 or so, I was already imagining how much money this will make when it's turned into a film.

On the flip side, because I haven't been through ten other books with him and his other detectives, and because I don't get a load of back story, I didn't really care about him too much. \n The mystery itself was fine, although not the sort I usually flip over. I adore Christie's big 'reveals' with Poirot where the murderer is shown up and all is explained. James is much more understated about it (more modern, perhaps?), and as a result I felt it was a bit anti-climactic. Dalgliesh suspected who it was, pretty much knew who it was, and then they just had to get evidence and then catch him. So not a lot of mystery. \n Beautifully written, though.

He bounces from character to character without ever giving the reader so much as an inkling of whiplash. It's especially effective--essential, really--when Lisbeth Salander gets into a bit of trouble and disappears from the story for a bit. Because we're in everyone else's head so much, it drives the reader crazy with tension for not knowing, but not crazy for inadequate writing, which could have easily been the case. \n Salander is a rock star in this story. She's hacking, punching, macing, smirking, eating Billy's Pan Pizza, and doing other Salander-esque things. Characters from Millenium #1 are developed more fully here, and we get oodles of new ones, too (my personal favorite was the boxer Paolo Roberto). I was happy to see Blomkvist here again, though he was a bit more in the background until mid-way through the book. Larsson also ties up a major loose end from #1, which made me sigh with relief. He also gives us another, smaller, loose end with Blomkvist's newest lover (I cannot wait to see who plays him in the almost certainly to-be-made films. What a player!). This early teaser and other hints make me way excited to read on for the third one, though it looks like I've got to wait until October to get my hands on it. I have a feeling we're going to read a lot more about Salander's sister... \n So, definitely check this out, but you'll do yourself a favor by reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo first; it's not necessary for the plot, but it's really nice for the character development.", "date_added": "Tue Jul 28 18:18:44 -0700 2009", "date_updated": "Tue Dec 10 16:43:32 -0800 2013", "read_at": "Sun Aug 30 00:00:00 -0700 2009", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

Cullen reported on the tragedy the day of the shooting, but it's taken him nine years to research and compile this book, which is thorough, dispels many myths, and brings to light information that has only recently been released. \n I listened to this audio-book, though I want to re-read it in \"actual\" book format. Cullen doesn't approach the story chronologically and this organization was, at first, frustrating and difficult to tell when he was switching between times and characters; however, once I got to know the ten or so characters he was focusing on, it was much easier, and about a quarter of the way through reading the book I was thankful he organized it that way. It was hard enough--emotionally--to listen to the shot-by-shot account of the massacre, but I don't think I'd have been able to listen to it at all if it had been built up to for seven or thirteen hours and then came at the middle or the end (another reason I want to read the hard copy is so that I can clarify some timeline questions I have but skip some of the more gruesome sections). Also, by breaking up the massacre into bits and splicing them among stories about the planning leading up to the event and the survivors and community dealing with the aftermath, Cullen's story is much richer and I got a very full sense of each character and of the school and community themselves. \n Cullen's writing is both poetic and objective. He uses the third person when writing about the media throughout the book, and it feels well removed. Too much--or any--first person would have made it feel overly sentimental and perhaps exploitative. There are still questions left unanswered, but I feel like I've got a handle on what happened and why it happened, which is some small sort of consolation. \n This took me a very long time to get through because of the subject matter.

Flynn writes interesting and well rounded characters and puts them in a rich setting. The story itself is good.

I preferred the female point of view to ITW's p.o.v. of Rob Ryan if only because Ryan was kind of a dunderhead mid-way through the book, especially about his and Cassie's relationship.

And of course she's only written two books. Great. \n This mystery/drama/thriller by French is perfect for anyone who likes an unconventional who-done-it. There are two mysteries intertwined, and though we only get to solve one of them, it's surprisingly satisfying. \n 'Woods' is narrated in the first person by Adam Robert Ryan, an Irishman who was abducted with two of his young friends when they were twelve; his friends disappeared, presumed murdered, and Adam escaped and survived, left with no memory of the event or the day that led up to the event. He grows up, becomes a murder detective, and partners up with Cassie Maddox (one of my favorite new heroines and apparently the star of the French follow-up, which I'll be reading soon), a young, tough, former narcotics cop. They catch the case of a twelve-year-old who's been found, murdered, in the same wood where Ryan and his friends were taken. \n The use of Ryan's first-person narration is key to the story, and French handles the male perspective spot-on (from what I can tell--men, is she indeed spot-on?). Things not so clear to Ryan are naggingly suspicious to the reader, and, as we find out, to Cassie Maddox as well. The case they're working does get solved (though it's a frustratingly unsatisfying punishment for the killer) and the tension building up to the end had be yelling at the book and thumping my steering wheel while listening to it in the car. And although we don't get to solve Ryan's original case, somehow French's writing makes it oddly okay. \n This is perfect for anyone who enjoyed Donna Tartt's 'The Secret History' or who likes plain old well written mysteries.", "date_added": "Wed Sep 03 19:09:33 -0700 2008", "date_updated": "Wed Jun 20 13:54:34 -0700 2012", "read_at": "Fri Sep 26 09:20:55 -0700 2008", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 1, "n_comments": 2}

Or, rather, my cup of chocolate. \n *Original Review: August 10, 2008* \n It's been a few months since I read an Agatha Christie, and this was a nice return to my old friend Hercule Poirot. It's a first person narration, as told from the p.o.v. of Dr. Shepard, a general physician in a town Poirot has retired to. \n It's reminiscent of the Hastings books, and Poirot mentions his dim-witted friend a number of times. I had an odd feeling about good old Dr. Shepard early on, and wondered whether he might not be an unreliable narrator (one of the most fun kinds, really). I pushed down my suspicions, but was eventually proved correct by the end of the book, which was thrilling because the 'murder reveal' by Poirot at the end of the story usually comes as a complete shock to me. \n Maybe I'm getting better at solving these; the next one I read I might know the murderer before even Poirot himself does!

Now, that's not to say it's not good, but it lacked the high-tension ending--a denouement equal to the rest of the book--that the others had. The middle of the book was super-stressful, and I thought I'd rightly pegged Eric Lenz as a double-crosser, which he never turned out to be (and I have a feeling that I haven't seen the last of him...). But there was major action and kidnapping and murder that never really panned out; it just sort of fizzled away. Highsmith does a great job of maturing Ripley, especially in these last two novels (this and Ripley's Game). He hasn't exactly grown a conscience (actually, far from it), but he's not the hot headed sociopath we love so much from the first two novels. He's still adventurous, courageous, calculating, and a bit brash, but he's more emotional and, actually, a bit melancholy. That might have to do with the ending of this particular book (not a happily ever after...), but now, thinking more about it, the tone and action fit quite well.

The second third sustains interest as suspicions mount and the story becomes a WhatReallyHappened? thriller, although the story line takes some increasingly bizarre and incredible turns.

She fills her time and pays her bills making copies of paintings for a reproduction service --not a crime when sold as reproductions. And she is a Degas specialist. The story is fiction, but is based on the fact of a still unsolved theft from the Gardener Museum. Painting and painter detail is important to the plot and interesting as well. \n The plot moves between the painter's present copying of a Degas for a gallery dealer, as part of a bargain to get her own show, to a past painting for a friend. Gradually we learn about her first bad decision. Interspersed are 19th century letters of the Gardener behind the museum to her niece; a note at the end tells what is history and what is fiction--the letters are fiction. \n As Claire, the artist, researches technique she begins to question the authenticity of the piece she is copying. She falls in love with the gallery dealer. And as they say, the plot thickens. The book is entertaining and from the middle, hard to put down.", "date_added": "Sat Oct 03 15:25:58 -0700 2015", "date_updated": "Wed Nov 23 20:51:29 -0800 2016", "read_at": "Wed Nov 23 00:00:00 -0800 2016", "started_at": "Thu Nov 17 00:00:00 -0800 2016", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

Bear with me. \n Billed as a sequel to The Shining, I felt this book fell short. I've read the Shining more than once (yes, despite it's awkward at times prose and POV mishaps, it is worth it). Even having read it multiple times and now being in my *ahem* rather late thirties, when I read the Shining last fall in anticipation of this book, I still had times where I got goosebumps and jumped at random noises and shadows in the house. Despite the fact that it's starting to get long in the tooth (HAH, DS readers will chuckle), the Shining still serves as a great book for getting a bit of creepy fright. \n Doctor Sleep, a continuation of that story, held no fright. There was suspense, and even action, but no spine tingling, bone chilling, jump at the shadows because two keys on the piano just started playing and no one's there scare. While a lot of that is due to who King has become as a writer in the last few decades, focussing more on the weaving of a good story over giving his readers the heebie jeebies, in a book that is supposed to be a successor, its absence was noteable. There was a type of urban science fiction (for lack of a better term) that was really popular in the late seventies and early eighties dealing with psychics and ESP. A fine enough topic, and this was a great book in that sub-genre, but without anything to counter balance it I was left wanting. This was a psychic hero explores his life and powers book, not a REDRUM thriller. \n As a sequel, then, I give this three stars. It did not stand up to the bar that was set by its predecessor. The book would have been better suited if the lead character had not been named Danny Torrence - then it would have been just another King affectation of setting one novel in the world of another (Sidewinder).

Suspicion, and superstition, cause accusations to be thrown at most tribe members, but especially on Enga because of her outspoken belief that the leader was murdered by one of them instead of an outsider, as the tribe would like to believe. \n In addition to the murder, Enga's tribe must deal with electing a new leader, the scary prospect of moving their village to better hunting grounds, personal injuries and natural disasters. \n The book offers a gloriously detailed and innovative imagining of prehistory and prehistoric customs (the tribe do not communicate verbally; they mind-read), along with a satisfying murder plot, several conspiracies, and a few romances. It was an engrossing read, and I would follow the characters on through other books if the author decides to make a prehistoric series. \n I would recommend Death in the Time of Ice to anyone who, as I did, enjoyed the Jean M. Auel Earth's Children series, or who would like to savor a good whodunnit set in a completely new surrounding. \n I received a copy of Death in the Time of Ice in exchange for a review.", "date_added": "Fri May 30 08:15:49 -0700 2014", "date_updated": "Fri May 30 08:16:00 -0700 2014", "read_at": "", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 1, "n_comments": 0}

While that was true for Nightmare in Morocco, I found that I was not receptive to a book in which the exotic setting is itself a villain. \n Nightmare in Morocco is about a young American travel guide who lives in Spain. Her boss pleads with her to guide a tour to Morocco just once, but she is haunted by a bad experience traveling in that country as a child. She agrees to do the tour, even though a family tragedy occurs and she is left as the guardian for her wild step-niece. The main character, Noa, is understandably stressed by several factors--her job and her recent family problems, for example. However, she spends so much of the book dwelling on her childhood trauma in Morocco (she got lost in a bazaar) that it made me question how the character could believably have chosen to be a tour guide as a profession. For someone who had supposedly lived and traveled abroad almost since birth, according to the backstory, it was hard for me to accept that Noa would be so prejudiced and socially sheltered. \n Because, though there are also human baddies, Morocco itself is a sinister presence in the book. And, I don't think I was the right reader for that kind of story. \n Nightmare in Morocco is a short read and contains both a mystery and a romance. The romance was more fun than the mystery for me, though I enjoyed following the threads of the plot in both. Several of the characters are also enjoyable, and some of the scenes that feature a more lighthearted atmosphere--such as the camel ride--are fun to visualize. \n I wouldn't recommend this book as travel inspiration for Morocco (a country which I have, in fact, visited), but if you are looking for a shorter read in a 1980s-style romance, take a look. \n I received a copy of Nightmare in Morocco in exchange for a review.", "date_added": "Fri May 30 07:40:24 -0700 2014", "date_updated": "Fri May 30 07:41:39 -0700 2014", "read_at": "", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

I also might add that I love cheesy Lifetime movies and \"light\" murder mysteries a la Mary Higgins Clark. This book, however, was so repetitive, boring, and downright boring that by halfway through, I knew the only reason to keep reading was to be able to write this review! \n Here are a few highlights: \n -The cast of characters/suspects in this tale are so dull. The author kept listing them, describing them, describing their offices, over and over. Even so, I couldn't seem to keep them straight and honestly, I really didn't care to try. I felt like I was at work - if I were to work at a really boring foundation. Such a terrible setting for what could have been an interesting premise (being able to read a cat's mind). \n -Even the main characters weren't well developed. And some of the plot points involving them were just ridiculous. Chloe is such a \"free spirit\" that she fails to even mention all of the serious crime and vandalism that has been going on at her place of work when she asks her sister to take over her job? (Seriously, what workplace would even let an employee bring in a random relative to take over her job while she is on vacation in Tahiti? How long is Chloe planning to be in Tahiti anyway?). And the idea of Chloe writing such a long and descriptive letter but not having the time to actually talk to Neela? About anything?? And when Neela finds out that she and her sister are the number one suspects in a major theft, she doesn't even try to reach Chloe to discuss it with her? (Steve was able to reach her when he tried). I'm just not buying any of it! \n -This is random but at least three times the author used an unusual word/phrase twice within a short amount of time. So odd. Examples: the words \"sardonic\" and \"ebullient\" - when you see it once, okay. When you see it again within a chapter or two - weird. The worst was the phrase \"halfway across a continent\" to describe Oklahoma relative to California. Used not once but twice. I get that Neela was feeling far from home - but she was in Oklahoma, not Australia! Oklahoma is only a few states away from California! \n I feel badly writing a negative review but this book is definitely not worth your time. :(", "date_added": "Sat Dec 08 11:55:58 -0800 2012", "date_updated": "Sat Dec 28 10:19:32 -0800 2013", "read_at": "Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 -0800 2012", "started_at": "Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 -0800 2012", "n_votes": 8, "n_comments": 3}

The two go to Jack's hometown, where they acquire a property known as The Doctor's House, famed to have been built by a doctor, who later killed his wife and himself in the house. The townspeople also want to host a Halloween ball at the house. However, after acquiring the property, Juniper discovers the body of the mayor's daughter, Kaitlin. \n While working at the house, Juniper often hears music coming from an unknown source and glimpses the lady in white, whom some townspeople claim is Veronica, the Doctor's wife. \n Although the dead body appears at around chapter seven, the setting of the stage is not boring but rather interesting and fun, giving the reader a good feel of the setting and the characters. \n \"It was a dark-haired woman in a light lace dress creeping up the mansion's front steps. A gush of wind sent fallen leaves dancing down the steps around her. She was pale as a ghost.\" \n In addition to the mystery, Juniper continues to suffer from jealousy as her business partner, Jack is getting married soon to none other than \"Sally Big Boobs\". \n Apart from Juniper, there is Pike, who co-jointly owns the bakery with Lulu who owns the neighbouring clothes store. Together, they named the business \"Cookies and Corsets\". The cafe's wicked assortment of desserts had me drooling as I read. \n Because it's a small town, there are a lot of relatives in the story, which boggled me sometimes, especially with the non-recurrent characters. I felt like I needed a family tree. \n There were a lot of characters I liked in Cookies, Corpses, and the Deadly Haunt, such as Pike, Officer Cody, Juniper, and Lulu. \n The romance in the novel was fun to read and clean. It also added a bit of awkwardness and humour for the characters. \n However, a problem I had with the book was that, and I can only assume this, the book was at some point written in first person then changed to third person (or vice versa). The book is mostly narrated in the third person; however, there were some instances when J. suddenly switched to first then back to third. It was just weird and interrupted the narrative.

The couple, recently turned billionaires, after the loss of a family member, love to do charity work. \n As part of coverage of their fundraiser, they show news reporter Chloe Parsons around their House of Horrors for children. Later the next day when they gather to see the story on TV, they learn that Chloe has passed away. \n Sara feels that Chloe has been murdered, making their investigation harder as the police are also investigating it as a 'murder'. Plus, it's just a hunch for Sara. Not long after, Chloe's sister comes to their private investigations firm and asks them to investigate her sister's death, giving Sara more momentum to carry on. \n Throughout the Halloween Is Murder we see Sean act as the voice of reason, particularly as he doubts that Chloe was murdered.

Even though the characters are unsure if the mystery at hand is, in fact, a mystery, the pace isn't slow. \n It is interesting to read Halloween Is Murder, when my introduction to the cozy mystery genre was through Carolyn Arnold's Coffee Is Murder (Book 9) in the McKinley Mysteries. The books are all standalones, but it was interesting to see Arnold's writing style again, get cozy with the McKinley's and re-live the series. \n \"People referred to money as the almighty dollar, but she was one American who worshipped the coffee gods and the almighty bean.\" \n I also liked Sara and Sean's humanitarian side, which made the novel all the more enjoyable. \n Halloween Is Murder is light and enjoyable, with a good cast of characters, lots of humour, and a Halloweenish-edge. \n Overall rating: 5 stars \n (Note: I got an Advanced Reader's Copy (ARC) for Halloween Is Murder)", "date_added": "Fri Aug 04 07:14:54 -0700 2017", "date_updated": "Tue Oct 03 00:55:41 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Sun Aug 20 11:18:48 -0700 2017", "started_at": "Fri Aug 18 15:36:34 -0700 2017", "n_votes": 1, "n_comments": 0}

Is the first word that comes to mind while and after reading Lies She Told by Cate Holahan. The novel kept me on edge from start to finish. \n Lies She Told is about Liza, a suspense writer, whose first novel becomes a bestseller, but her subsequent books barely make anything worth mentioning in her career. Now, she asks her editor for one-month extension to write a book, without an outline. \n Added to that, Liza's husband's best friend and law partner, Nick, has disappeared, straining Liza's relationship with her husband at a time she is looking to conceive. Things go from bad to worse when Nick's body is discovered bludgeoned to death and Liza's husband is arrested for his murder. \n There are two parallel worlds in Lies She Told, the first is Liza's, while the second is that of the main character in her work-in-progress, Beth, who recently had her daughter Victoria and suspects her husband is cheating on her. \n Liza says that she bases her stories on real people, while changing their names and making a few additions. As the book progresses, the reader can't help but notice how true that is. Some events are repeated, even some quotes taken out of Liza's friends' mouths. \n \"I don't invent my characters. I steal them from my surroundings. To be a writer is to be a life thief. Every day, I rob myself blind.\" \n I enjoyed the parallelism between the two worlds. Liza makes up for what she doesn't have through Beth. When the novel begins, we learn that Liza is taking experimental drugs to conceive; in the story, Beth has done the same but was able to have Victoria. Similarly, Liza's mother passed away, but Beth's is alive and well. \n I liked the development of Beth's character, which, in a way, is reminiscent of Nora in Henrik Ibsen's The Doll House. \n Bit by bit, Beth begins invading Liza's world, making comments in her, or rather Liza thinks what Beth would say in certain situations. Sometimes, Liza attempts to shut her character out of her head, and other times, Beth reprimands her author for her decisions. I liked this a lot, as well as the arguments between Liza and her character. \n \"I've created a character that would be far more adept in this situation than I am. I need to think like her.\" \n I couldn't tell if the pace in Lies She Told was fast or slow because of the constant suspense. I also liked the use of quotes at the beginning of the book, and at other parts in the book. \n There are many memorable and beautiful quotes, images, and phrases throughout the book. The dialogue is nicely included in both narratives. I liked Liza's notes on writing, which can act as writing tips to readers and writers in general. \n \"My emotions don't vacillate between happy and sad like a pianist alternating between major and minor scales. They're stuck in a discordant chord.\" \n One of the things I disliked, however, was that I felt that Jake, Beth's unfaithful husband, did not get what he deserved at the end of the book. I also wanted to know if Beth's story would be Liza's newest bestseller. \n Every time I put Lies She Told down, I kept trying to remind myself that both Liza and Beth were just characters, that this was all fiction. They were just too real. \n Half-way through the book I knew this was a five-star read. Finishing it, I confirmed my expectations. Lies She Told gave me palpitations while and after reading. No book has ever done that to me! \n Overall, Cate Holahan's Lies She Told is a must-read psychological thriller, but it's not for the faint of heart, with its constant suspense, and will give you a hard time separating fiction from reality. \n \"Blurring fact and fantasy is my trade. I am a con artist. A prevaricator. I make up stories. So why does he think this one is real?\" \n Note: I received an Advanced Reader's Copy (ARC) of Lies She Told by Cate Holahan via Lori Great Escapes Book Tours in exchange for an honest review as part of a blog tour.", "date_added": "Wed Jul 19 13:41:23 -0700 2017", "date_updated": "Fri Sep 08 05:13:31 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Tue Sep 05 14:14:18 -0700 2017", "started_at": "Thu Aug 31 05:13:55 -0700 2017", "n_votes": 2, "n_comments": 0}

Set in the small town of New Camel, the mystery is revealed from the beginning when Kailyn and her aunt Tilly go to see their lawyer and find him dead. \n \"In this town, heavy traffic was five cars lined up at a red light.\" \n Magic & Mayhem has an assortment of wonderful - and less friendly - characters, but all of whom have a role to play. There is Kailyn, whose magic, along with that of her family, has suffered a bug of late, as well as her aunt Tilly, who reads palms - although the accuracy of her readings can be questionable. \n Kailyn follows her mother's advice and attempts to summon a familiar, a kind of animal guide believed to help witches with their magic. Instead, she discovers an old man in her basement who goes by the name of Merlin. To her and Tilly's surprise - and to the reader's - the great wizard himself was somehow thrust forward in time from the Middle Ages to Kailyn's storeroom. \n \"Did this man really expect me to believe he was the legendary wizard? He looked more like a Don Quixote wannabe.\" \n One of the funniest and most entertaining aspects about Magic & Mayhem is Merlin's adjustment to and discovery of the gadgets of the modern world, from the toilet to the iPod to pizza. \n I loved the references to books and movies, as well as all the magic and witch-related terminology which gave Magic & Mayhem a truly magical feel. It made me feel I was part of the story. The overall word choice of the novel was perfect and the narration was highly enjoyable. The imagery was interesting and impeccable throughout. I have never seen so many perfectly-worded similes in one place. \n \"The kettle had gone from whistling to screeching like a banshee, by the time I plucked it off the stove. Merlin stood in the middle of the kitchen, rotating like a clumsy ballerina.\" \n After the discovery of the dead body, Kailyn begins her own investigation and several townspeople attempt to help her in any way they can, whether through throwing gossip her way or through actual help. Kailyn's curiosity is commendable, especially after she begins receiving death threats, and with the fact that the best suspect for the murder is her best friend Elise. \n \"There was no telling what would happen to history if Merlin died in the twenty-first century. It was bad enough that he would return to his time babbling about computers, aircraft, and men on the moon.\" \n As a cozy mystery, Magic & Mayhem fits all the characteristics, having a fair share of quirky characters, cats and a well-penned mystery. I liked how romance did not play a major - or even minor - role in the novel. \n Characterisation and setting were among the aspects that drew me in to the novel as well. Each character was well defined and the setting was realistic. Coupled with the fast pace of the novel, I couldn't put the book down. \n Almost before I was half way through the novel did I expect to give it a five-star rating. Having finished, I'd definitely give it 10 stars and can't wait to get my hands on the second instalment in the Abracadabra Mystery Series by Sharon Pape. A must-read at all costs. \n \"If we ever figured out how to send him home, it might to be with a pizza oven.\" \n Note: I received a free copy of Magick & Mayhem by Sharon Pape in exchange for an honest review as part of a blog tour with Lori Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours.", "date_added": "Fri Feb 24 06:36:18 -0800 2017", "date_updated": "Sun May 07 14:23:29 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Sun May 07 14:23:29 -0700 2017", "started_at": "Sat May 06 13:29:34 -0700 2017", "n_votes": 2, "n_comments": 0}

It seemed as if the massive wooden doors were nailed shut in order to keep them from spilling too much information.\" \n The Steps by Latvian author Iveta Redliha is a gripping but heartbreaking story centered around people who lived or were connected to a property called The Bradbury. \n Leonora, a fresh-out-of-school greedy graduate who is secretly hired to become a surrogate mother. She views the opportunity as easy money, and posh living and lies her way through to get the job. She thinks she will have the time of her life partying, but soon realises that her dreams will not come true as the family she's being a surrogate for insist that she live on their premises, the Bradbury, for the duration of the pregnancy and under their rules and supervision. \n Kurt and Nelly are a married couple who have been unable to conceive. They hire Leonora through a surrogacy programme to carry their baby. The moment the three of them arrive at the Bradbury, the reader meets Greta, their maid and helper, whom Leonora immediately despises and mistreats. \n Meanwhile, Reyna receives a phone call, telling her that her mother has died. The investigation soon dries up after it is discovered that her mother died of a heart attack and not murdered. However, things don't add up to Reyna. Her mother had left their shared tea shop without closing down and had been meeting with an unknown man. \n When Reyna receives the will, she discovers that her mother had been keeping secrets, including recently purchasing the Bradbury mansion. When she visits the run-down house, she encounters Lucas, a secretive but handsome man, who entices her from the first moment. \n \"Shivers ran down Reyna's spine. For a moment, she thought his last words were meant as a threat. The stranger's look had been so sharp and penetrating, horrifying and exciting at the same time.\" \n Lucas, on the other hand, appears to despise Reyna, even though he has never met her before. However, bit by bit, he too begins to develop feelings for her. Lucas is a little reminiscent of Heathcliff from Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, except that The Steps is a much better and more exciting book. \n The Steps is gripping from the start. Its pace is fast, especially as the author jumps between scenes and characters without being all over the place. \n I felt that Reyna was too gullible and very trusting, particularly of strangers. She was also a bit slow, and while I realise that the purpose of her slowness is to confirm the reader's suspicions or unveil new information for the reader, I still felt she could have been a little smarter, especially since she's not a child. \n I like that there are no superfluous characters in The Steps. Each character has a role to play, including the quirky, helpful and ever-giggling Lucy. Sometimes the reader wonders if she's crazy, but she is definitely the main source of comic relief in the novel. \n Another character in the novel is Greta, the Bradbury's maidservant. What I liked about her is that she has her moments. In addition to always keeping tabs on Leonora, she sometimes even makes Leonora think and wake up from her attempts at seducing Kurt. \n Lucas strikes the reader as a calculating character from the start. I like how Iveta Redliha give the reader bits from Lucas' thoughts, making excellent opportunity for suspense, especially since he does not mean Reyna well and the reader has no idea why he feel such animosity to someone Lucas has never met. \n I liked how Iveta Redliha kept me guessing, connecting the dots, then guessing all over again. \n The Steps handles a variety of themes like family, marital relationships, greed and growing up. I like how the author made the characters progress differently. Not all of them move forward, but all the main ones had some sort of character development, particularly Leonora. \n One of the few things that bothered me about The Steps was the speech. There was no use of quotation marks. Instead every line begun with a dash, and there were intermittent dashes in between, making it hard to follow on who is speaking and what is part of the characters' thoughts. \n Some chapters were rather long, particularly at the beginning. I don't like stopping mid-chapter. \n I liked the use of imagery, both metaphors and similes throughout the novel. The description of the setting is quite picturesque and nicely done as well. \n \"Once their eyes locked, they couldn't look away, the gaze of their blue and grey waters merging into one whirlpool.\" \n The Steps is full of irony, role reversals and all the literary elements a reader can dream of. Simply brilliant. \n I couldn't put the The Steps down, and when I wasn't reading, I kept thinking of the characters. When I finished reading, I couldn't stop thinking about them. \n \"A quiet noise, like a moan or a sigh broke the silence thus startling the visitors. Lucas took it as a sign that the old building was weeping with him. If only he were alone and could let loose his suppressed grief about the house, once a beautiful home, turned into an abandoned shack, just like his soul, like his whole life...\" \n I liked how Iveta Redliha tied up all the loose ends at the end and I was glad I was able to correctly guess many if not all of them. \n Overall, The Steps is a suspenseful, heart-breaking, gripping dark tale of a house and its inhabitants.

After she calls the police and other work colleagues start filing in, Candy begins to see that her boss was not simply mean but that almost each of her colleagues had a reason to want him dead. \n \"No sign of forced entry. No sign of a struggle. Seems to me it had to be done by someone who could just walk into his office, pick up the letter opener, and get close enough to him to stab him. That'd be you, wouldn't it?\" \n Candy has a sarcastic side, that is very realistic especially about the work place. We are told that Candy is always the first one in the office every morning. \n \"The door to her boss's office was ajar. Sleink himself in early? Incredible, Candy thought.\" \n Her conversations with each of them, and the way each worker in the hotel expects another to have committed the murder, open her eyes to the dark side of her - now - former boss. \n I related to Candy immediately after I discovered she was a bookworm with an interest in mystery novels. \n \"Innocent or guilty, the accused in the mystery novels she read always \"swore\" that they didn't do it. Candy never found that particularly convincing and yet here she just did the same thing.\" \n The novella is too short for much character development, but at least Candy has had to learn the truth about her boss and all her colleagues, although most truths weren't nice ones. There may also be a possible romance with the new police officer, Petrowski. \n Murder by the Book is an interesting book title. I particularly liked how Candy and Petrowski solved the murder. \n \"The alcohol in Edna's breath told Candy that the woman had more likely spent the morning with Jim Beam than with Earl Grey.\" \n Murder by the Book is a highly recommended novella by Devorah Fox, a first time author for me, but definitely not a last time one. \n Overall rating: 4.5 stars \n Note: I received a free copy of Murder by the Book via Escape with Lori's Virtual Book Tours in exchange for an honest review as a part of a blog tour for the book.", "date_added": "Wed Dec 14 16:46:21 -0800 2016", "date_updated": "Fri Feb 24 15:11:36 -0800 2017", "read_at": "", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 2, "n_comments": 0}

To make things worse, the same man had accused her of stealing his antique grape press and told the police as much. \n Maddie is then forced/asked - which ever you decide - to investigate the man's murder, with her former school nemesis Laurel Hammer being right on her tail and constantly trying to drag her to jail, especially after Maddie accidentally set Hammer's hair on fire. \n While investigating, Maddie can't help but notice that her mother is acting strangely and so is her mother's entire group, the Ladies' Aid. \n \"It was one thing for me to discover a dead body, another to suspect my mom had some knowledge of the crime.\" \n After the discovery of the dead body, a Romeo Paganini, Maddie keeps telling herself that she wouldn't interfere with the investigation, especially after the last one nearly got her killed. \n \"This investigation--\" \n \"I'm not going to interfere.\" \n \"Oh yes you are, Madelyn.\" \n As with the previous book, Pressed to Death sees Maddie investigating a case that is supposed to be the police's responsibility as well as a historical cold case pertaining to her recently-acquired antique grape press. \n A relatable character, I absolutely loved Maddie, even more than in the first book in the series. She has a strong sense of what is right and what is wrong, even if that means that her actions will hurt her. She is also caring, has good instincts and has learnt to trust them. This is significant for her character development. \n Narrated from the first person perspective of Maddie, Pressed to Death allows the reader to see how Maddie's mind works as an amateur sleuth, and engrosses the reader in the novel, the events and the mystery-ies. \n \"Haven't you ever seen something you can't explain?\" \n \"Yeah, the way people tend to drop dead in your vicinity, and it's never your fault.\" \n There were a lot of beautiful lines and images in the novel. The characters are down-to-earth and I liked the friendship Maddie, Harper and Adele have. \n \"I wanted to evoke the romance and mystery of tea, using lush descriptive phrases.\" \n \"Lush? These are pornographic,\" Harper said. \"No wonder people were snatching them up.\" \n Pressed to Death is the second instalment in The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum series, but can be easily read as a standalone novel. \n Overall, Pressed to Death is a perfect Halloween read and enjoyable cozy mystery. \n Overall rating: 5 stars \n Note: I received a free copy of Pressed to Death by Kirsten Weiss in exchange for an honest review as part of a blog tour by Lori Great Escapes Book Tours.", "date_added": "Thu Dec 08 14:38:42 -0800 2016", "date_updated": "Thu Mar 16 14:58:30 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Tue Mar 14 16:48:21 -0700 2017", "started_at": "Sat Mar 11 02:56:08 -0800 2017", "n_votes": 4, "n_comments": 0}

It does have almost all the criteria of a cozy, but the mystery aspect is significantly lacking in the novel. In fact, at some point - almost towards the third of the book - I had to go back and reread the synopsis to remember why I picked up the book in the first place. \n The mystery is about the lantern, but until almost half the novel, there are only a few mentions of it and it is thrown to the background and is not considered a pressing matter. \n The novel has a very strong opening with the possible ghost of Anne's late Aunt Sybil, the introduction of the mystery woman who dies in Anne's arms and the old Irish lantern. \n While I liked that the mystery was not about a person specifically, but rather about an object, I didn't like that I had to read chapters on food, antiques, buying and selling that didn't pertain to the mystery itself. There were many chapters that I could have easily cut out because, for me, they neither moved the story nor helped the mystery. \n There was also something in the narration. Sometimes the sentences were too short; it felt like I was hitting walls rather than full-stops. At other times, the narration felt like it was a story told to a five-year-old. So it felt out of place and irritating - throughout. \n I did like how we got know more about Anne through her actions. She is carefree, spontaneous, and disillusioned. \n In terms of characterisation, I couldn't stand Anne. I tried, I really did. But I couldn't. She's a quirky character, an aspect for a cozy; however, the quirkiness makes the 40-something antique shop-owner act like a five-year-old ALL THE TIME! She's immature, and impulsive. Yes, she's kind. But, unbearable. \n I did, however, like her friend CC, who I might add was the one who pretty much did all the research and 'cracked the case'. Still, CC, who has a few quirks of her own, was sometimes irritating. She is a know-it-all kind of character and likes to narrate history to anyone who'd listen. Like Anne, I got bored of her rambles and sometimes wanted to skip some parts. \n In a guest post by the author, published here on the blog, I discovered that Vass has a different and more enjoyable writing style. She also mentions that she lets her characters take her wherever they want - hence I would presume the chapters that for me weren't needed. \n Of the quotes and lines I liked were: \"Old farmhouses in the middle of nowhere on rainy nights were better left to cozy mysteries than real life.\" \n \"CC half expected to see a hobbit answer the door when she knocked. The woman who answered was a bit taller than a hobbit but not by much.\" \n One of the reasons I finished the book was to see if the unraveling of the mystery would WOW me or not. It ended up being a bit complex but the mystery-solving came in the last third of the novel. It was also rather rushed, like \"oh my the novel is about to end and I haven't solved the mystery yet!\" \n By p. 159 (that's 75% through), there was at last some development! I thought the novel would end while the mystery remained in the trunk of the car. \n The conversations between the characters were mostly basic, bits that can be skipped. Some were too long and useless. \n I liked that there was a good bit of a historical background, making the novel a historical fiction cozy. \n Of all the notes I kept writing throughout Key to a Murder, was pointing out how immature Anne was and how many of the events don't lead to anything. \n The good side about reading this novel was learning a few tricks for my own writing. \n My overall rating for Key to a Murder is 1.5-2 stars. \n I had high hopes for this novella, most of which didn't come through. \n Note: I received a free copy of Key to a Murder by Vicki Vass in exchange for an honest review with Lori Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours. But since my review is less than 3 stars, I opted to keep it till after the tour was over. \n I'm honest and I don't hold back on what I like or dislike about a book. But it wouldn't have been fair to post this review as part of a promotional tour. \n I would, however, recommend you read the guest post by Vicki Vass, titled \"Blurring the Lines between Reality and Fiction\". \n http://nadanessinmotion.blogspot.com....", "date_added": "Sun Nov 06 06:06:43 -0800 2016", "date_updated": "Fri Nov 18 17:01:51 -0800 2016", "read_at": "Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 -0800 2016", "started_at": "Sun Nov 06 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

In this instalment, the novel is set in Budapest, Hungary. \n Cait goes to Budapest to teach for a month; there one of her students, Zsofia, asks that she look into her grandmother's death which occurred almost 40 years prior on Cait's university campus at UVAN (University of Vancouver). \n As Cait begins to meet other family members, exercising her psychology tactics and having her husband Bud, who had to remain in Canada, dig into the unclosed mystery, things begin to spiral in a new direction, as the case opens fresh wounds for many. \n One of the things I liked about this instalment was Ace's use of books, a saga to be exact, that might mirror what has happened to the family. The author also handles a variety of themes and problems such as Alzheimer's and alcoholism, to keep Cait - and the reader - away from finding the truth. \n Regarding alcoholism, Ace carefully utilises the problems accompanied with it in the book and characters. \n Having lived with a person whose memory was often ravaged by too much liquor, I recognised the expression that flashed across Alexa's face; she couldn't recall exactly what she'd said to her daughter the night before, and experience was telling her she'd never be able to retrieve the lost words from the black hole where they'd sunk without trace. \n The Corpse with the Ruby Lips is quite realistic; I particularly liked how the renowned psychologist Cait isn't perfect and despite her intelligence can be gullible at times. \n I was speechless. She'd used me! She'd researched me, found my weaknesses, and just plain used me. And I'd fallen for it. I'd actually liked her. \n As always, Cait's little insights never fail to impress me. I particularly liked this part where she describes a music manager who had come to look at new artists and sign them up. Cait's emotions are clear and easily transferred to the reader. \n He handed out cards, his fingers lingering on Zsofia's as she took one. I felt everything in me clench - not just because of the way his eyes were sliding across Zsofia's bosom, but because the way he presented himself wasn't endearing at all; there's only so much bling a person can wear before you begin to wonder why they need to have that much gold about their person at all times. \n The book is not devoid of humour and bit of sarcasm. \n \"'Careful' is my middle name,\" I mugged. \n \"Not it's not, and it never will be. Your middle name's much more likely to be 'catastrophe.'\" \n Narrated in the first person, The Corpse with the Ruby Lips has many beautiful lines, imagery and quotes. The overall narration is exciting, even when events don't seem to be moving forward. \n \"Words can never be unsaid. They ring in our ears forever - sometimes when we least want them to.\" \n Overall rating: 5 stars. \n Note: This review was originally part of a blog tour with Lori Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours, but due to commitments I was only able to publish the guest post titled \"The Effect of Words\" by Cathy Ace on my scheduled date.

After submitting his report of the incident, Danny is forced into an early retirement. Two years later, he is approached by a beautiful young-looking woman, claiming she is from a lesser known FBI division called the Paranormal Investigative Division (PID). \n The woman, Angelica, tells Daniel that what he had seen two years prior was true and that the PID is responsible for weeding out dangerous paranormal creatures, like Vincent. Danny struggles to come to terms with these revelations, but accepts to help Angelica catch the rogue vampire. The two slowly become attracted to one another, igniting a bit of a romance, which has deeper roots than the reader expects. \n Stake Out is fairly gritty but nonetheless exciting with likeable characters. I liked how the reader got the viewpoints and flashbacks of various characters throughout the book. \n \"He also knew that Angelica would personally kill him if he did anything to compromise the investigation. Her body might be 24, but her mind was older and more cunning than even Gandalf!\" \n One of the things I liked about the novella was the use of songs at the beginning of each chapter. It added a gothic feel to the book. \n I liked how Luchesi was to the point in the novella, while also keeping the reader on edge by feeding us bits and pieces of history about Angelica, Vincent and even Danny and the PID. I also liked how she had me guessing at events, many of which proved true and others I had to wait for the revelation. \n I also liked how Stake Out has a closed and open ending at the same time, prompting the reader to want to know what happens in later books. \n Overall, Stake Out kept me glued to the Kindle screen till I finished it. \n Overall rating is 5 stars. I definitely would love to pick up the next books in the series.", "date_added": "Wed Aug 24 04:52:05 -0700 2016", "date_updated": "Tue Dec 13 04:29:46 -0800 2016", "read_at": "Sun Dec 11 00:00:00 -0800 2016", "started_at": "Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 -0800 2016", "n_votes": 2, "n_comments": 0}

And damn that was a super-paced good read, perfect for a bibliophile and a mystery lover! \n The story's main character Charlotte - Charley - Carpenter, the owner Old Hat, a clothing store, is part of a reading group focused around mysteries. She joins the rich-women's book club with the ulterior motive of attracting buyers to her vintage shop. \n The book opens with the scheduled books to be read between August and December. The group of 8, called the Agathas Book Club, with each member labelled \"an Agatha\", tackles a book each month. Set in the small town of Oakwood, Ohio, the book also opens with the shocking revelation of a murder. \n The Agathas are shocked to discover that the victim is an acquaintance. They also realise that the victim was positioned in a way that reflects the murder of the book they were reading. Soon after, another dead body emerges, also linked to the book club members. \n \"Most of the Agathas seemed to be enjoying themselves, as if the poor woman had been killed for their entertainment. Be honest, Carpenter. You're just as curious as the rest of them.\" \n Each character in the novel has a role to play: corpse, amateur sleuth, killer, suspect, police officer, helping hand. \n The detective investigating the killings is not-an-old-friend of Charley, but her high school crush Marcus Trenault. As soon as they meet, old love and trouble are rekindled. As the two suspect that the killings are done by a woman, Charley suggests that they are likely to have been committed by an Agatha and convinces Marc to use her as an informant to infiltrate the Book Club. \n \"Don't be fooled by the expensive armour, most of these women are scared to death, usually of one another.\" \n Charley is a fun, slightly sarcastic character. She smart, brave and passionate. She's also realistic and down to earth. At one point, she faces Marcus and tells him: \"You owe me an apology.\" \n I felt that The Book Club Murders was more crime and sleuthing than plain cozy mystery. I loved it nonetheless and would definitely pick up the next books in the series. I also enjoyed the romance aspect of the novel. \n The imagery and emotions in the novel were well-written, with lots of \"show don't tell\". \n I absolutely loved the mystery-book references and how the author brought in published mystery novels and used them in the murders. This book will have me picking up several mystery novels and adding them to my lengthy - possibly never-ending - to-be-read list. \n \"No one is going to believe that for a second. Look, this is the twenty-first century. Everyone watches CSI and Law & Order or whatever. If you start asking questions about who left when, and did you notice anyone acting suspiciously, how long do you think it's going to take before people figure out what you're really up to?\" \n And the mystery... that was plain wicked! \n Note: I received a free advanced readers' copy (ARC) of The Book Club Murders by Leslie Nagel as part of a blog tour via Lori Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours, in exchange for an honest review.", "date_added": "Fri Jul 29 16:23:02 -0700 2016", "date_updated": "Tue Sep 27 16:34:37 -0700 2016", "read_at": "Tue Sep 27 16:34:37 -0700 2016", "started_at": "Mon Sep 26 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 1, "n_comments": 0}

Brilliantly wicked! \n Bullied in his teens, 21-year-old Jeremy Riker looks to become a police officer to do some good and stop bullies. But an injury renders him slightly deformed and obliterates his dreams of joining law enforcement. Despite extensive training, he is denied the opportunity to join law enforcement several times. So he becomes a kind of vigilante and considers opening his own private investigations (P.I.) firm with his friend and mentor Max. \n Highly trained in martial arts, spotting bad guys, and a host of other skills, Riker is seen as the perfect person for law enforcement despite his injury. \n \"I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the past several hours had been anything but random. Someone out there knew my history.\" \n Unknown to Riker, a killer, named The Spyderco Killer because of the Spyderco (a kind of knife) he leaves in his victims' backs, has set his eyes on him but continuously eludes him, until he - the killer - decides to go on a killing spree, hitting close to home for Riker. \n Although the novella is called Riker's Calling, there are only two instances where the narration is from Riker's perspective. We get the killer's views, movement, and action, but in the third person. \n One of the things I liked about Riker's Calling is Lamoureux's way of giving the reader information through a variety of sources such as a news anchor, tweets, and people talking about events. We even get bits of Riker's history from the killer's perspective. \n I thought the novel was a bit gritty at times, especially since the killer slashed his victims' throats but there was a little more than just throat slashing. \n \"Fifteen cigars - nine with red bands, to represent the past nine years of silence and therefore the nine victims to come, and six with yellow bands, for any collateral damage that might occur.\" \n The novel spans almost two decades but starts in the present time with bits of flashbacks and Riker and the killer playing cat and mouse. \n I liked Riker's narration, especially how relatable he was, using examples from crime series like Law & Order, and mentioning notes on crimes and criminals. The irony in the novella was mind-blowing at times! \n Overall, Riker's Calling is meticulously connected; it's brilliant! Lamoureux is lauded for his twists and for creating a genius killer. It is definitely a five-star action-packed must-read. \n \"Truth is rarely blossoming with flowers. More often than not it's cold, it's hard, and if you're not in alignment with it, it'll smash you to pieces.\"", "date_added": "Thu Jul 21 05:41:19 -0700 2016", "date_updated": "Sun Sep 24 00:36:38 -0700 2017", "read_at": "Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 -0700 2017", "started_at": "Mon Sep 18 00:00:00 -0700 2017", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

While, I've seen others comment that Spider Bones is not Reich's best. I felt overall disappointed. \n The beginning put me off as I felt that Brennan - or the author or both, I couldn't tell - appeared to be showing off with her French. The novel begins in Quebec, where French is commonly used. But as a reader of English I have no need to know what each place is called in French and what it means in English. I felt it was pointless. \n The mystery began as intriguing with a bizarre death, originally may have been ruled as some kind of mistake by a John Lowery. As the novel progresses, there seems to be a link between this case and another. As Brennan finds out that John Lowery had died in the war in Vietnam and was supposedly buried. \n So far so good, but Brennan takes up another case in Hawaii, things get confusing, whether in switching between cases or worse when there is a possibility that the cases might be linked. \n From there, Spider Bones takes confusing to a whole new level. There were parts that I kept rereading to figure out what I had misunderstood and others where I gave up and thought I'd just make it to the end - which was also confusing. \n There were a lot of medical terminology, to the point where I felt that the book is recommended for med students or doctors, but at other times the information was simply written and informative. \n \"Dead hearts don't pump. Bleeding at a trauma site usually means the victim was alive when injured. No blood usually means the hit was taken postmortem.\" \n I liked that Brennan was often sarcastic. I couldn't be sure whether I liked or disliked her overall in the book. \n I honestly had bigger expectations for the Spider Bones. And it is not often that a series (or movie) turns out to be better than the book. But this is such a case. \n Overall rating: 2 stars", "date_added": "Mon Jun 27 16:17:58 -0700 2016", "date_updated": "Mon Sep 05 16:57:33 -0700 2016", "read_at": "Sun Jul 10 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "started_at": "Tue Jun 28 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 1, "n_comments": 0}

The first chapter opens with two bombshells for psychologist Cait and her new - and newly-retired cop - husband Bud Anderson, who learns from his mother, Ebba, that he had an uncle and that that uncle was now dead. \n Cathy Ace expertly weaves in comic relief also from the first few pages to relieve the tension she built on the first page of the novel. \n The uncle, Jonas, leaves a letter for Bud and gives him a task to uncover a long-dead mystery that took place early in Jonas' life. In his letter, Jonas tells Bud: \"I cannot tell you who I am. No man can do that of himself. He is only the person he is because of how people know him, and what he has done. It is time for what I have done to be understood.\" \n When we first meet Ebba, she describes her brother, saying \"Jonas was a bad boy,\" whereas when we begin to meet Jonas' friends in the Netherlands, some say \"He was a good man.\" The contrast puts the reader in the middle, awaiting to find out which of them is right about the estranged uncle. \n Cait and Bud travel to Amsterdam to fulfil Jonas' will and uncover a mystery if there is one. There, they learn about who Jonas was through his friends. \n \"His facial muscles gave away almost nothing; the throbbing vein in his neck told a different tale.\" \n Soon enough they begin to feel that the accounts given to them of Jonas are contradictory and that some of the friends seem to be hiding something. \n One of the fun things about the Cait Morgan Series, is how Cait observes people, pointing out tiny hints about their facial expressions or tones. \"The only problem was that, although he was saying all the right words, his tone wasn't utterly convincing.\" \n The Corpse with the Garnet Face tackles art, lots of it, since Jonas and his friends were artists and painters. However, there were some parts that I felt were too detailed in the art world that a normal reader - like me - would feel lost. These parts, I felt, would be more appreciated by someone who majors in art. \n I liked the chapter where Bud and Cait create a timeline of the events they've learned. I felt it was a bit like a nicely-written history book. \n \"First of all, I know we've established that everyone has lied to us, and they've also tried to muddy the waters.\" \n I did, however, feel that the conclusion to The Corpse with the Garnet Face was rather confusing, even as Cait laid out all their findings, I still felt lost. \n Still, I liked how Cait and Bud were able to uncover not only the mystery they were sent to Holland for, but several others pertaining to Jonas' group. \n The Corpse with the Garnet Face is certainly a different cozy mystery read. A mystery that produces more mysteries and keeps the reader's mind working. \n \"All I wanted to do was fulfill my uncle's wishes, and be able to go back to Mom with some knowledge she could cherish about the guy. Instead, there's all of this...I don't know, this atmosphere of things not being what they appear to be. I don't like it.\" \n Overall rating: 4 stars \n Note: I received a free copy of The Corpse with the Garnet Face in exchange for an honest review. \n Check out my book review of The Corpse with the Diamond Hand here. \n http://nadanessinmotion.blogspot.com....", "date_added": "Sun Jun 19 05:26:36 -0700 2016", "date_updated": "Mon Jul 25 17:26:24 -0700 2016", "read_at": "Thu Jun 23 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "started_at": "Sun Jun 19 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

She says: \"I usually didn't get much attention from the opposite sex, other than from my attitudinal cat, Gumdrop, but I don't think he counts, nor does Stanley the Bassett hound.

The first chapter opens at the Rose Cottage Cafe owned and run by Mandy Hemphill and we, along with the Mayor's wife, are informed that the Mayor has been killed and likely murdered. \n From here, the novel begins to cover various angles of who could have killed the Mayor, while it is implied that the murder weapon may have come from Mandy's kitchen. \n \"Solve a murder? I don't solve crimes, I...I bake muffins.\" \n As Mandy tries to clear her name and find out who would want to frame her, her customer numbers keep dwindling. We learn that Mandy had submitted a request for a patio to be added to her cafe but the late Mayor had turned down her request. \n Mandy, along with the new tenant in her building, Ben, who is resurrecting a local newspaper, begin to snoop around and ask questions, while the police continue to be anywhere but near the real culprit. \n There isn't much imagery in the novel, but the sweet treats and other foods made at the Rose Cottage Cafe make up for that. Moreover, the writing and the characters are very realistic, which makes the reader feel as though they are part of the novel. \n \"It was hardly a secret to her staff that Mandy found baking therapeutic. It was a big part of why had chosen to go into this business in the first place. Of everything she did in her life, nothing made her feel happier and more at peace than baking.\" \n The chapters are short and the pace is quick, prompting the reader to carry on without thinking. \n There were a few repetitions in the novella that bugged me a bit, but overall it was a fun read. \n I also liked that Mandy did not get the guy at the end but that after the crime was solved, all the good characters were rewarded in some way or other, like justice being served but in different ways. \n Quick, cozy, and with many sweet treats, Big Hair and Buttermilk Pie is a quick read, that can easily be read in a day or sitting. There are also two recipes at the end of the book to complement the reader's appetite for the Rose Cottage confectioneries. \n Overall rating: 3.5 stars \n Note: I received a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review via Lori's Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours.", "date_added": "Fri Apr 22 06:21:11 -0700 2016", "date_updated": "Wed Jun 01 15:38:49 -0700 2016", "read_at": "Tue May 31 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "started_at": "Sun May 29 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

It begins with Blaire Baker, who volunteers as a teacher at St. Sebastian Orphanage, who is going to meet up with another volunteer, Travis, a nurse, so they can head together to the house where they will spend a year. \n St. Sebastian is not an ordinary orphanage. It is a place where people come to leave their 'unwanted' children. \n \"The loneliness she carried was dark and telling of a grotesque obscurity of the heart, one that haunted her every move and moment.\" \n While there wasn't much room for character development, considering that at several points in the novel, the reader thinks that Blaire may be insane or imagining things, there was a bit of development in Blaire's overall perception of the world. She learns that wealth might mean nothing to her but it means a lot for others, especially the children. She starts out as wearing diamond earrings but soon discards them after realising that this is not the place for them. What she does for the children also denotes character and care, the latter being a trait that was she was denied after her parents' death. \n The language in the novel was beautiful, although a bit verbose at time but overall interesting, descriptive and enjoyable. I loved the flow, and narration. The imagery too is spectacular throughout. \n \"Blaire emerged sluggishly into consciousness like a sea-bound castaway finally trudging unto shore.\" \n I liked how the author made the reader think that Blaire may be hallucinating or imagining things. It made me doubt that she might be the one who is psychologically unstable, with visions and a wild imagination. It also helped give a sense that the novel might be real or paranormal at some point. \n Suspenseful and scary, Black Water Tales: The Unwanted nearly had me pick up the bad habit of nail-biting! \n The novel is rich in characters of all ages, ideas, beliefs and all levels of creepy. \n I like Jean Nicole's use of foreshadowing and the way she gives the reader a foreboding feeling of what is to come. For example, the first description we get of the train heading for Borslav is \"It exhaled noisily as if it had been running a marathon all day. Garish dinging blared from speakers on the platform, and the doors of the train opened wide, releasing mobs that fled so furiously one could have easily assumed that this was the last stop before the end of the earth.\" \n The short chapters helped the already fast-paced novel move even faster. \n One of the things I really liked about Black Water Tales: The Unwanted was that it was not only a horror novel, but it also had a mystery or rather several mysteries about the place (St. Sebastian), the children and even Blaire. \n \"Unspoken questions filled the room, like ocean water pouring into the lower decks of a sinking ship, and suddenly everyone was rushing to escape.\" \n Black Water Tales: The Unwanted has gripping imagery, flow and storyline. It is as scary in the morning as it is at night. \n I also particularly enjoyed Jean Nicole's show-don't-tell technique, as well as her ability to make the reader feel as scared, confused or any other emotion as Blaire and the other characters felt. \n \"Borslav was no Kerchaviv. It was Chernobyl-like, miserable and secluded with the faint pulse of previous life still vibrating through its damaged carcass of crumbling buildings and forgotten items, a dismal reminder of lives left behind in the fire.\" \n I liked how the author kept misleading the reader till the very end, making them question almost everything and doubt everyone. \n Although the reader is left with some questions, the novel does not have an open ending. \n Overall, Jean Nicole's Black Water Tales: The Unwanted is a must-read for all. Although I recommend you don't go for it before bed. \n I literally had to turn on the lights for this one! \n \"A feeling of dread surged through her. All eyes in the classroom grabbed [her] like hissing snakes, stretching out of their sockets, coiling around her.\"", "date_added": "Thu Mar 03 08:20:49 -0800 2016", "date_updated": "Fri May 20 09:28:21 -0700 2016", "read_at": "Thu May 19 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "started_at": "Mon May 16 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 4, "n_comments": 0}

Jack, too, has a paranormal side to him, although he is not a vampire. \n \"He noticed that his eyesight had improved and that he could see perfectly no matter how dark, his sense of smell had become so acute he could smell a break baking at the bakers over a mile and a half away...\" \n There is also the mystery of a secondary voice inside Lucius' head. Although we are told that that is for another - much longer - story. \n \"You have to be quick about it, Lucius.\" Spoke a dusty voice but Anne did not hear it.\" \n I like how the story unfolds. Some of it may appear as cliche, one man asked to kill another, but the ending - I definitely did not see that one coming. \n \"One day he came to the belief that there isn't anything quite as thrilling as hunting man, the most dangerous animal of all.\" \n Overall, The Story of Lucius Cane is an interesting and quick read. It certainly makes you want to carry on with the rest of the series. \n Overall rating: 3 stars. \n Note: I received a free copy of The Story of Lucius Cane from the author in exchange for an honest review.", "date_added": "Mon Feb 22 15:24:27 -0800 2016", "date_updated": "Sat Apr 30 08:03:42 -0700 2016", "read_at": "Wed Mar 23 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "started_at": "Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 2, "n_comments": 0}

The two women are confronted with the dead body of a not-so-likable acquaintance, Christy, in chapter one. \n Christy, it seems, had a knack for making enemies. While reading, you can't feel sympathy for the dead woman. It also appears as though everyone had a motive to kill her. \n \"Mother always told me to stay positive. But I can't help feeling like another show is about to drop.\" \n Maddie has significant faith that the police will handle the case with care and find the killer. However, she soon discovers that the school bully, Laurel Hammer, is one of the detectives in charge of the investigation, and it seems she has a grudge against Maddie. \n The first introduction we get of Laurel, apart from reminder of Maddie's friend Harper, is this: \n \"Laurel Hammer banged open the door to the interview room. \"So which one of you two idiots killer her?\" \n Maddie constantly tries to get people to tell the police what they know, and tries to do the same herself, but the police look at her as a likely suspect, especially when a second body appears; another fairly dislikable acquaintance. Even after they arrest her friend Adele, Maddie tries to be the good citizen and help the detectives. \n The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum is narrated from the first person perspective of Maddie, who gets many funny and entertaining thoughts. She is also down to earth and realistic, so it is easy to imagine her and imagine being in her place. Also, we go deeper into her character as she hesitates about managing the Paranormal Museum, while job hunting after being fired from her previous job. \n \"Dion Fortune's scrying mirror.\" [said Herb]... \"Of course, I'm asking ten thousand.\" \n I coughed. \"Dollars?\" \n \"But for you, five.\" \n \"Thousand?\" I wouldn't pay five thousand for Ali Baba's mirror. There was no way anything in the museum cost that much. \n The overall pace is fairly quick. There is constant moving and events, but in terms of solving Christy's murder, things are a bit slow. There was also the GD cat, a recurring theme in paranormal novels, although I couldn't understand that cat or its intentions. \n The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum is home to second mystery, one which Maddie stumbles upon, immerses herself in and takes it upon herself to solve. The mystery revolves around the picture of a woman named Cora, who is accused of murdering her husband. \n I truly enjoyed the mystery within a mystery, and how Maddie goes about in order to search for two killers, one dead and one alive. \n Another thing I enjoyed is how Weiss constantly made the reader think and doubt if the Paranormal Museum can live up to its name by being haunted - or not. Up until the end of the novel, the reader has doubts. \n \"The atmosphere thickened, choking. The quiet stretched, the only sound my own harsh breath, breath I could see in the air. It was a nails on a chalkboard silence, a deep silence that tightened my throat, made me tremble.\" \n I particularly liked the development in Maddie's character, a trait not often seen in mystery novels. When we first see Maddie, she has low self-esteem, and who can blame her after nine months of job hunting with no development in getting a job. But as the novel ends, we see a significant change in her character, both in her attempt to catch the killer and in her negotiation skills. \n The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum is a quick, well-written and light read, with a mystery within a mystery and possible ghost. \n Note: I received a free copy via Lori Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours in exchange for an honest review as part of a blog tour for the book.", "date_added": "Tue Feb 02 17:19:59 -0800 2016", "date_updated": "Thu Mar 17 21:17:48 -0700 2016", "read_at": "Thu Mar 17 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "started_at": "Wed Mar 16 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 1, "n_comments": 0}

The novel begins with Jax O'Connell receiving a letter from the lawyer of her late aunt Rita, who offers to give her her house in Seattle, on the condition that she - Jax - must do what she loves. \n The letter, contains two of the most beautiful lines in the novel: \n \"I know inside your tired heart is a woman waiting to start living.\" Then she sets the condition, \"You must live in my house and find your creative passion. I hope my gift helps you live the life you love.\" \n Jax accepts the offer and begins to make beads in a studio she sets at the end of Aunt Rita's complex. \n The novel is narrated from Jax's first person perspective, which is fun since Jax is sarcastic, fun and very down to earth. \n High Strung revolves around a bead makers' event, hosted by Rosie at her shop Aztec Beads, which includes several workshops given by various bead makers from several states. \n Rosie is an obnoxious and domineering character. Even her dog is annoying. \n \"Rosie was a fireplug of a woman; her dark hair, complete lack of neck, and right now the intense look of anger on her red face made her look like a very serious fireplug.\" \n Ms. Peacock does a great job in drawing her characters, bringing them to life and making the reader feel as if they were part of the setting and the novel as a whole. It is easy to imagine characters; in fact, I felt as if I'd become part of the book and that going out the door I'd find Aztec beads and Jax around the corner. \n Two events take place almost hours apart: Rosie is strangled by her own bead necklace and shortly after another character is killed. At first, it is unclear whether the events are connected, and later Jax and her best friend Tessa work on the how and why they may be connected. \n Although the actual mystery does not begin till halfway through the book, High Strung was a fun read, especially since the characters had day-to-day ups and downs and interactions that would seem bizarre in real life but are believable when read. \n The only thing I disliked about the novel was how the mystery was unfolded; it was kind of sudden in a weird way. I wanted a stronger confrontation. \n Still, I liked how ordinary people had to run around looking for clues and interviewing their friends in order to discover who the killer was and why they did it - Don't depend on \"Detective Grant\" for that. I also enjoyed Jax's and Tessa's analysis of what they had, the possible motives and so on. \n I also loved the use of bead-imagery with regards to the mystery. At one point Jax tells Tessa: \"We just have to sort through the junk. You know, like organising a jumbled box of beads. All we have to do is put each piece in its proper place, and we'll be able to see what we have.\" \n In High Strung, it is clear that the author has done massive effort and research to provide explanations for the bead-making process and descriptions for the beads, which were all colourful and just made you want to see - and acquire - many of them in real life. \n There's also lots of comedy from start to finish, making it an even cozier and more enjoyable read. \n \"I didn't think an exploding cake was a reason to call 911, so I called you instead,\" Val [told Jax]. \n \"My own animal companion was going to have a kitten (although anatomically impossible for a variety of reasons) if another animal of any kind entered his house. I was sure Gummie considered this his house, and that he let me live here simply for his own convenience, because I knew hwo to open cat food cans.\" \n One of the best things about the novel, apart from character depth, is character development. Both protagonist Jax, and the \"fireplug\" Rosie see some development towards the end of the novel, which is rare in mystery novels in general. \n Overall, High Strung is a fun, cozy read with beautiful characters and an interesting mystery. It is also a great start to my reading list for 2016.", "date_added": "Thu Sep 10 22:54:29 -0700 2015", "date_updated": "Sat Jan 09 14:03:13 -0800 2016", "read_at": "Thu Jan 07 00:00:00 -0800 2016", "started_at": "Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2016", "n_votes": 4, "n_comments": 0}

She literally remembers everything. However, she explains to Ezra how people perceive things, saying \"As human beings, we're not capable of experiencing the world as it is - we always experience it as we are, with all our faults, flaw, preconceptions and prejudices filtering and infusing everything we perceive.\" \n Since the novel is narrated from Cait's perspective, we get her first impressions on everything. She's quick to notice things, especially the slight tremors and changes in people's movement or behaviour. For example, a little after Tommy dies, we meet with the captain of the ship. \n \"But the captain's micro-expressions told me he was still feeling the weight of the suspicious death on his shoulders.\" \n One of the lines that made me smile while reading and that is interesting for people looking to enter the mystery or crime genre was something medical, to which the Rachel, the ship's doctor said \"It doesn't always happen, and it certainly doesn't happen as often as those who create fiction would have us believe, but it seems to have happened here.\" It is both funny and ironic. \n I liked the author's use of \"show don't tell\" and her ability to make the reader see, smell and connect things in her book with real life. For example, when Cait says \"My nostrils told me we were nearing the medical area,\" the reader immediately remembers the smell of anaesthesia and disinfectant. \n Although there isn't character development, as is the case with most mystery novels, yet the reader comes out enlightened about several notions and ideas in life. \n The Corpse with the Diamond was not free of gala dinners, elegant dresses, tasty food, that had me wishing to go on a cruise ship, and confrontations. \n I enjoyed Cait's comments to herself as well as her quick assessments and body language readings of others. The novel was fairly-paced. Although it covers a period of two days, still I felt the ship's passengers were doing \"a lot\" in those two days. \n I also liked how the author managed to make every character have a motive and I enjoyed the gathering they had where Cait drew out the perpetrator(s). \n Finally, I was intrigued by the pun in the name of the book The Corpse with the Diamond, but I'll leave it at that and that it had me going in another direction. \n \"Experience changes us all...Sometimes it hits us like a wall, so vast we cannot fail to acknowledge it. Other times it seeps through the cracks in our daily lives until we accommodate it, almost without noticing. But it changes us all.\" \n As part of the blog tour with Lori's Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours, there is an ongoing giveaway.

There are also letters written by Jack the Ripper. \n Annabella has a scar on the back of her neck, while she doesn't have complete memory of how she got the scar; she knows that on that day she lost her ability to hear. \n There are several mysteries in Initiated to Kill, some are major and some minor. Sharlene Almond constantly gives the reader bread crumbs of information, keeping the novel interesting at all times. \n One of the things I enjoyed about the novel was Annabella's insights. Being deaf, she has to rely on her other instincts and observations of facial expressions, enabling her to decipher more than what people actually hear. She is able to decipher tiny gestures that can easily be invisible to the average person but not to her. \n I also liked the short chapters in Initiated to Kill, which, along with pace, help the novel progress quickly especially since it's a long novel. \n \"But now, something was approaching. Some that felt like a train hurtling along the tracks, unable to stop or slow down. A train that would end in a wreck, lives ruined and lives lost.\" \n The novel opens with a scene from the past related to masonic events and rituals. Shortly after, we are introduced to the mystery of a missing girl and the detectives Valero and Rivero, who despite trying hard to find the culprit(s), are always a step or two behind. \n Until chapter 87, the perpetrator is a mystery, only referred to as \"he\" and \"him\". From one side, the investigators don't know who he is, and from the other, we as readers see him luring the girls, who see him as someone they trust but we don't get his name. \n The novel has a lot of characters, but each of them has a role to play. At first, I thought there was no need to mention the names of the prostitutes from the Jack the Ripper scenes, but later I realised that these names were the actual names of the victims from that period, highlighting the historical aspect of the novel. \n \"A glass smashed, a door banged closed. Silence filled her ears. An unwanted tear ran down her cheek. She peered at the sun, wishing the magic that would turn the moon to the sun would take her away. But nothing would rescue her, and she could not leave.\" \n Usually when the reader feels that an answer to one of the many questions has been revealed, several more arise. \n One of the things that didn't go well with me in Initiated to Kill was the going to and back in the timeline. There is the time of Jack the Ripper, which is clear, but there are references to Annabella's childhood, other events in the past and events in the present. There is a lot of jumping between the present and the past, which in turn is divided into several periods, some are from the late 1800s and some are from the 20th and 21st centuries. \n I would have preferred that the going in back in time parts were clearer, especially for Annabella and in order: 1999, 2000, 2001 and so on. \n I also did not enjoy not knowing who was speaking or who the character in front of me was in several chapters. There was a lot of he/she that caused more confusion than suspense - for me at least. \n Once the reader feels they've got a grip on things, the author catapults us backwards or forwards in time and things become confusing once more. \n \"Another night of dreams left a nauseous feeling in my gut. That something was going to happen. I never believed in psychics, never believed I had any ability. But the overwhelming sense that something bad was going to happen intensified every night.\" \n An interesting and new element in Initiated to Kill was the introduction of a new character towards the end of the novel, which added to the mystery and overgrowing list of suspicious characters. \n The overall pace of the novel is quick, but it picks up significantly towards the end with a lot of action and chasing of the culprits or more victims. However, this rise in pace brings in additional confusion, especially when the police discover that there seems to be several perps. \n My copy has several typos and spelling mistakes - that bothered me, a lot. There was also a lot of repetition in certain places like: \n \"Stepping back, he allowed them into his spacious office. Mahogany furniture dominated the spacious office.\" \n Furthermore, two other mysteries arise at the end of the novel, namely: the identity of Annabella's father and the reason why the perpetrator wants her dead. \n I both liked and disliked Almond's way of leading - or misleading - the reader in thinking who the perpetrator is and guessing at other events and character in the novel. \n \"Celestina's absence was like a hot coal refusing to extinguish.\" \n A reader of Initiated to Kill would also need to be strong enough to handle some gritty and grotesque scenes, particularly those related to Jack the Ripper. The novel also requires a lot of patience and thinking. It's not a book you can read before you go to sleep (it's gritty in some parts) and it needs someone who is alert and ready to think. \n Sharlene Almond is applauded for the massive amounts of research carried out for Initiated to Kill, as well as the beautiful descriptions used with a variety of places, especially the University of Seville. \n The confusion aspect in the novel was tiresome for me; hence, my overall rating is 3 stars. \n Note: Although I finished this novel a couple of months ago, it's taken me a while to write my review due to the complexity of the novel and the massive amount of bookmarks and notes I've put in and written. (My apologies for the delay).", "date_added": "Wed Jul 15 11:56:20 -0700 2015", "date_updated": "Sat Mar 05 18:06:11 -0800 2016", "read_at": "Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 -0800 2015", "started_at": "Thu Oct 08 00:00:00 -0700 2015", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

Spiritualist-witch June Heal, who owns a small cures shop in Whispering Falls, is on her way to see one of her products sold outside her village, which is depending on her sales to boost its own economy. Whispering Falls is village of witches, each owns a shop that caters to their powers and abilities. \n June, owner of A Charming Cure, senses her customers' troubles and designs the perfect lotion, cream or potion for them. Tiffany, a customer who came in during Christmas, sees June's stress-free lotion as the saviour to her business, Heat To Toe Works. However, problems arise on June's first day and soon after, Tiffany's husband and co-owner of the business is discovered dead on June's product belt at the factory. \n Although the book is the seventh in the series, each can be read as a standalone. In the opening scene, I felt I was bombarded with the characters from Whispering Falls and their shops, which I thought could come in later because I would never remember who was in charge of what. \n There are several plot lines in the story. There is the murder-mystery, June's upcoming marriage to Oscar, which doesn't seem to be going as smoothly as it should, and a break-in and theft in June's shop. \n June, along with her cat or fairy god-cat Mr. Prince Charming, stick their noses in the murder mystery to find out who is bent on stopping June's project and dream. Meanwhile, June's and Oscar's aunts are working hard to get a date set for the wedding, thus, pressuring June. \n At one point, we discover that the marriage is an arranged one, giving June doubts. Both her parents are gone, so she starts to suspect if she's been tricked into falling in love with Oscar. \n A Charming Fatality is a fast-paced cozy magical-mystery novella. It's my first mystery in the paranormal genre. \n There were parts, especially regarding June and Oscar's relationship that I didn't feel much, or felt they could be improved but the overall mystery, clues and resolution are absolutely five stars. \n Kappes skillfully leads her readers across a wide range of suspects, only to unfoil something - or someone - else entirely at the end and that was a well-done job for me. \n The novel is narrated in the first person from June's perspective and we get her emotions, worries and hopes. It is clear she is caring and the whole Head To Toe Works move is stressful for her, not only because she wants to help people, but because she feels that she needs to help her village's economy; it is the first time anyone from Whispering Falls receives an offer to go out into the mortal world. \n In terms of comic relief, A Charming Fatality is generally light. There was a scene with two sisters and an ostrich that was really funny but totally out of place in terms of tension-and-relief. \n Overall, A Charming Fatality was a quick, different and enjoyable read. Although not everything clicked with me, I truly enjoyed how Kappes unfoiled the mystery and ended the story and that's the most important aspect of a mystery; a good-crafted one.", "date_added": "Fri Jul 10 18:31:17 -0700 2015", "date_updated": "Thu Jul 23 18:01:49 -0700 2015", "read_at": "Tue Jul 21 00:00:00 -0700 2015", "started_at": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 -0700 2015", "n_votes": 1, "n_comments": 0}

Her protagonists, Sara and Sean, were average people who became billionaires. They were also former police officers, so investigation comes naturally to them and they do it well. Sean and Sara open up a company to investigate cases that the police do not find worthy or grounded, like Sophie's. Their firm depends on one rule, which is that their clients must give the fees to charity. \n Sophie believes her mother died of cyanide poisoning through her coffee; Sara being a heavy coffee-drinker starts to keep her distance from at least coffees of the company in question, Tasty Beans. Sophie also tells the couple that her mother may not have been targeted. \n \"I never said she was targeted, but I do believe she was murdered,\" which makes it rather difficult for the group as this is only a hunch and they have to widen their investigation. \n The investigation/private-eye firm includes another former police officer, Jimmy, and computer whiz Adam. \n Coffee Is Murder moves slowly at first, as pair seeks to test the coffee, but picks up once they try to work at Tasty Beans. Nonetheless, it remains interesting, with obstacles coming up here and there. \n Jimmy, the third former police officer, is quite sarcastic and funny. He adds a lot of comic relief to the novel, especially when he goes to work for the coffee maker. \n One of the things I liked about Coffee Is Murder is how the writer shows that all the clues might lead to a particular culprit but that may or may not be the right one. \n Although mysteries do not have much character development, we see Sara and Sean's relationship sort of get stronger. They are married couple and they care for each other but the job sometimes requires sacrifices. At one point Sara might need to drink from the coffee and she is unsure if it has been poisoned at the time or not. \n The investigation firm does not have a name and while mulling the name after solving the case, their secretary, Helen, offers an excellent suggestion. \n The chapters of Coffee Is Murder are quite short, making the read a lot quicker. \n Overall, the novel is entertaining and fun. It does not deal with anything creepy like rape as other mysteries do. It is by all means a light, engaging and enjoyable novella. \n Check out the first chapter of the novella here as well as contact details for the author: \n http://nadanessinmotion.blogspot.com/... \n Note: I received a free advanced reader's copy (ARC) in exchange for an honest review and as part of a blog tour with Lori's Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours.", "date_added": "Fri May 08 06:35:43 -0700 2015", "date_updated": "Thu May 14 22:27:01 -0700 2015", "read_at": "Mon Apr 20 00:00:00 -0700 2015", "started_at": "Wed Apr 15 00:00:00 -0700 2015", "n_votes": 2, "n_comments": 0}

And while I don't like to use the word 'very', this book is by no means a light or quick read. \n The novel is about Emily, a seventeen year-old girl, who meets an eccentric boy called Jack, whose body is constantly failing and who thinks \"they\" are after him. Soon after, dead bodies start to appear and Jack is the main suspect. The deaths remind Emily of her friend Grace, who passed away before she moved to The Sham. \n The book opens with Emily walking her little sister. They come across a group of four girls, taunting and bullying a little boy. The scene is quite descriptive and not for the faint of heart. Jack suddenly appears and attempts to rescue the little boy, Charlie, from the bullies. \n Emily and Jack hit it off soon after and bit by bit become close friends, and boy and girl friend. The dead bodies that begin to appear afterwards are those of the four bullies from the first chapter. \n The pace of the novel is really slow; it picks up in some areas, but even then it is slow compared to other books. Even though there is a mystery, I felt it was a there in the background but the focus was on Emily and Jack and their relationship to the killings. \n Although The Sham is highly emotional, it is rather tiresome, or at least it was so for me. At one point, I felt like I didn't want to continue reading, and it took me nearly two months to finish the book, simply because I felt there wasn't much progress, like I was reading but not moving forward. I did want to resolve the mystery, and discover who Jack was. \n Throughout the novel, Emily feels responsible for protecting Jack, who is not very forthcoming when it comes to information about himself, but at the same time cannot help but wonder if her boyfriend is the killer. There are two investigators, whom Emily calls Red and Brown. The names given to them are a bit significant as Red is hot-tempered and more annoying and stressful than his companion. Brown is calmer and a little sympathetic towards Emily. The way the investigators pressed her for information, was nerve-wrecking for both the protagonist and the reader. \n I didn't feel that there was any character development. However, Emily's swaying between what she felt was her responsibility towards Jack and what the police believed was realistic. I didn't see Emily make a major realisation or revelation whether regarding herself or Jack. \n I also felt the characters were crazy, all of them, not only Emily and Jack, the latter may have run away from a mental institution, but also Piggy, Jack's and Emily's families, as well as the whole town. I didn't like any of the characters to be honest, and that put me off the book for a while. \n Jack was eccentric in many ways, including eating raw food and sometimes food from the bin, like eating 25 bananas just walking home or eating in the bathroom. \n I like the pun in the title, which I was sure was related to the heart of the novel from the beginning and even though at some point I felt that the author was leading me away from that pun. \n I also like how the ending sort of diverged into two parts, even after we discover the mystery behind the killings, there is still the mystery of Jack and the man Emily calls Piggy, who added an interesting touch towards the end. \n The novel has some good imagery and similes, and some descriptive and unconventional images such as: \n \"Like a bag of unexploded possibilities.\" \n \"Like we were now in the side act to the main play, dimly lit with an invisible audience tracking our every move.\" \n The book is around 250 pages long but I felt it was at least twice or thrice as much. The chapters or sections are REALLY long and I felt like I was trudging my way to the end. \n Apart from wanting to know who was behind the killings and making a promise to provide an honest review, I did not feel there was much to push me to keep going. In my opinion, I felt the novel needed more momentum. \n For Kindle readers, The Sham should be read in white, mint or sepia, as there are several colours used that do not appear in the black-background view.", "date_added": "Wed Nov 26 16:18:46 -0800 2014", "date_updated": "Wed May 06 12:05:16 -0700 2015", "read_at": "Sat May 02 00:00:00 -0700 2015", "started_at": "Sun Jan 25 00:00:00 -0800 2015", "n_votes": 1, "n_comments": 0}

I'm not sure when and where I got hold of a copy of this, but I've had it for a while and what better time to read a short horror story than in the spooky month of October! \n 'Paulie' opens with Alice, a mother of three, who recently moved from the city to a farmhouse. She is preparing dinner and waiting for her husband to return. Soon after everything is set, a most awkward and terrifying announcement is made on television and everyone is advised to stay indoors. The news anchor says that some sort of disease or symptom is affecting people and turning them into killers. \n The short story is about 14 or 15 pages long on PDF. It starts at a fairly slow pace but following the announcement, the pace picks up immensely. \n Paulie is the name of one of the characters in the story, and what I like about this story is the constant sense of mystery in what is going to happen and what is happening. \n Myers gives vivid description of every character and detail in his story, so there is nothing lacking in that area; the reader can easily picture everything. \n I liked how Alice is portrayed as a very strong character. In spite of pain, both physical and emotional, she struggles to go on and save whatever is left of her family. \n What I did not like about the short story was the very long paragraphs used and the occasional repetition of words used to describe the horrors Alice comes up against, but otherwise 'Paulie' is an enjoyable read. \n I was also curious, why this disease as I call it does not affect her of all people. \n Note: Glad I finally got to read it - if I had received it as a free copy for a review, my apologies for taking so much time.", "date_added": "Sat Oct 04 18:56:12 -0700 2014", "date_updated": "Mon Oct 27 14:06:39 -0700 2014", "read_at": "Wed Oct 22 00:00:00 -0700 2014", "started_at": "Sat Oct 18 00:00:00 -0700 2014", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

It's a novella but with a novel's weight in all the details, research, characterisation and depth it entails. \n The novel starts with a lab scene, an infant is being extracted from a failed experiment and a female scientist gives your life to save the child. The following chapters trace the life of this child growing up into Shane Fisher, a too-ordinary book store manager. \n The novel shifts between Shane and another character called Cole, a martial artist and assassin, and whom the reader later finds out is a replica of Shane from the experiment mentioned earlier. \n Naturally, when the two characters come in contact 'all hell breaks loose' as one of the chapters is adequately called. \n The description throughout the novel is detailed and vivid. I loved the descriptions of Trent and Manny, one is described as a dwarf with a malicious smile and the other is described as it is an ape among other huge animals, and is nothing short of a T-rex: big, bloodthirsty and stupid. \n Although Shane and Cole are very different, you can't help but like both, especially as there is a lot of Shane in all of us. \n Fragile too is a likeable character with intense depth and importance to the novel. \n Doppelganger ends at the climactic point and I can't wait for the second instalment, which I've been told will be out later this year.", "date_added": "Sat May 31 07:23:21 -0700 2014", "date_updated": "Mon Jul 21 15:04:24 -0700 2014", "read_at": "Mon Jun 23 00:00:00 -0700 2014", "started_at": "Sat May 31 00:00:00 -0700 2014", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

GHOST precedes ENTITLEMENT, and though I was familiar with the characters, I felt GHOST gave them more depth especially the lead detective/protagonist Angela. \n GHOST opens with the rape and murder of Amanda Jensen. Despite their best efforts, detectives Angela Masters and Julie Phelps exhaust all their leads and the case stays open for almost a year, until finally a new lead appears. \n In GHOST, we see a lot of character-background, which helps the reader form a better picture of each character. The pace of the novel is not as quick as ENTITLEMENT, since the case stays open for a while; nonetheless it is not a bad pace since it is divided into 46 short. \n Since the novel is set in 1986, DNA-testing is highly expensive, not unheard of but has never been used in court. It's not as easy as seen in modern TV-series like CSI. GHOST shows how good Angela Masters is as a criminal profiler; however, she eventually realises that criminal-profiling still bears much guess work as compared to real detective work. \n I must say GHOST, for me, was a quick read but was still slower than its successor ENTITLEMENT. \n GHOST is an interesting crime novel with a strange but happy ending.", "date_added": "Wed Nov 20 02:53:33 -0800 2013", "date_updated": "Sat Mar 01 15:12:01 -0800 2014", "read_at": "Thu Dec 19 00:00:00 -0800 2013", "started_at": "Sun Dec 15 00:00:00 -0800 2013", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}

They are all beautiful and enjoyable but do not compare to the pleasure and intrigue I experienced while reading The Grey Walker, Arete, Through the Tunnel, The Colour of Dishonour, Burning and The Painted Staircase - just to name a few. \n There are a few stories set in Rayne Hall's dark epic fantasy novel Storm Dancer such as The Colour of Dishonour, The Grey Walker, and Each Stone, A Life. Each of these stories is exceptional in its vividness, creativity and unfathomable twists! You have no idea what you're up against! \n Thirty Scary Tales boasts a ton of stunning imagery in this collection, whether scary or just plain beautiful. The reader cannot help but highlight and enjoy. The author also uses an array of settings for tales ranging from Germany to England to Turkey, and extending from Ancient Greece to the Middle Ages to modern times. \n One of the Storm Dancer-set stories is The Colour of Dishonour with its layers of puns and irony (\"I have blood on my hands\"). I still cannot shake off the admiration (for Hall) and the horror (for the Captain). The Colour of Dishonour is a 10-star story. \n By Your Own Free Will makes you think: How far would you go for love? How much are you willing to sacrifice to be noticed by one man? Would you trade your IQ for it? \n Special thanks to Rayne Hall for creating and collecting this set of stories in a single volume and for sending me a free copy of Thirty Scary Tales for a Halloween review. I enjoyed reading them all.

Her mixing of the psychological element with mystery and crime adds to the richness of her novel. \n Cache a Predator opens with a shocking scene, where an unknown person mutilates a dead man by cutting off his penis. This first part is narrated in the first person; and throughout the novel we get to see certain acts and scenes through the eyes of the mutilator; the \"pecker-whacker\". \n The novel also focuses on Brett Reed, a police officer in the town of Hursey Lake, who is divorced and whom the courts unjustly gave the custody of his five-year-old daughter, Quinn, to her alcoholic mother, Ali. We get to see glimpses of an alcoholic's life, and how it affects them and all around them. We also meet counsellor Sarah Grinwald, whose troubled past has led her to taking up a job that allows her to take care of people. There is also the irony that despite her job, Sarah is not a good judge of character. \n Cache a Predator has some beautiful imagery, which is seen in the opening lines of the novel. The description of a graveyard in particular has a dark but beautiful image. \"The way [The tombstones] were lined in rows, with husbands and wives side by side and children lying near their parents, made it look like a village, like shadows of square people hiding and watching without emotion. Like me.\" (p.6) \n Having a soft spot for alliteration and oxymoron, I particularly liked the phrase \"sweet sickly scent\" on p. 12. \n Cache a Predator opens with a gruesome but powerful first chapter. Chapter 2, on the other hand, starts in a totally different place with new people .We meet Quinn, her cop father and her jobless, alcoholic mother. We are also introduced to the 'injustices' of the justice system and how it has favoured an alcoholic mother over a civil servant, a police officer, whose main fault is having a bad temper. \n The novel takes the reader through the life of an alcoholic. Ali's house is a dump with cigarettes and garbage littering the floor, and both her daughter and dog are unfed. Reflecting Brett Reed's frustration with Ali's behaviour, Weidenbenner uses another gruesome but highly creative image in \"He clenched his jaw, took a few eggs out of the fridge, and whisked them, beating them until they frothed over the sides of the bowl like the blood foaming in his veins.\" (p. 19) \n The so-called 'protective order' is highly ironic. Who is it supposed to 'protect'? The drunk mother? Or the neglected child? And from whom?! \n Throughout the novel, Brett claims that his father had abandoned him when he - Brett - needed his support. It is my opinion that this fear of abandonment further drives Brett's protective instincts towards his daughter. The reader is also given a lot of evidence of the opposite or that he has changed. \n Weidenbenner maintains good tension and relief in her novel. She uses light comic scenes or discussions to ease her readers' growing tension. An example is seen after the police, particularly Brett and his partner Clay, find Jake Hunter, the first mutilated victim. The whole scene though absurd and serious is funny. Jake tells the officers regarding his cut-off penis \"Easy for you to say. Yours is intact.\" Shortly after, Brett jokes, saying \"Makes me want to wear iron briefs under lock and key.\" (p. 34). \n In chapter 5, the reader realises the reason the \"pecker-whacker\" does what he does. He does not choose his victims at random. And although one believes that it is a crime to mutilate another person, the reader cannot help but sympathise with this perpetrator, who is punishing sex offenders by cutting off their most prized organ; he is a criminal with a cause. \n Sarah Grinwald is a counsellor, who works some children cases with Child Protective Services (CPS). Although she's supposed to remain unbiased, we see her biased against Quinn's cop father at first, but later changes that bias. Sarah, like many characters in this novel, has had a troubled past, which, at first, affects her judgement of Brett and we see her trying to fit him in her preconceived notions of bad fathers. However, she cannot help but notice the similarities between Quinn and her father and Ali's evidently unhealthy and unsafe environment. \n In chapter 8, we learn a bit about Ali's past and upbringing. She's not an alcoholic without reason. Sarah explains to Brett how Ali views the world and how her past has affected her. Weidenbenner's use of psychology and past experiences is commendable as it gives reasons why each character is who they are and why they act the way they do. \n It is ironic that justice system makes things more difficult for its civil servants when compared to regular citizens. The courts favour the mothers over the fathers, even if the former were unfit. \"Sarah knew the courts, and typically the mothers came out way ahead of the fathers. Unless they could prove Ali was unfit, Brett didn't stand much of a chance.\" (p. 123) \n Narration in Cache a Predator shifts between the first person perspective of the \"pecker-whacker\" and the third person perspective, which either describes events or acts as a means to reveal certain things through the characters' eyes. One scene is described once through Brett's eyes and once through Sarah's. \n An important character, for me, in the novel is Brett's partner, Clay. He is both the sense of reason and light humour in the novel. He is much calmer and more reasonable than his partner. He gives a sense of sanity to the story and acts as a reference for comparison with Brett. \n The \"pecker-whacker\" obviously has bravery issues; it's clear that they've been bullied before, and they admitted to being sexually abused. In addition, there are some instances that reveal this person's slightly childish tendencies. They are also convinced that all fathers are bad; at a certain point they cannot tell right from wrong and cannot distinguish between their father and Brett. \n We also meet the abominable character of Mrs. Greer, Ali's mother. She appears twice in the novel and always succeeds to infuriate both Brett and the reader. When Ali crashes her car and kills a young woman, Mrs. Greer tells Brett \"Some guy came by to visit her. Said she killed his fiancee and he's going to sue her for everything she has. Said Ali took away his entire future.\" She sniffled. \"I told him he needed to talk to you. That you were responsible, not Ali.\" \n Quinn's ordeal, being kidnapped, reunites the Reed family and brings the community together. \n I enjoyed the police-work and crime language used in Cache a Predator. It feels like reading a bit of CSI. \n Weidenbenner's use of imagery never fails to surprise and inspire the reader. Another particularly beautifully-crafted image is on p. 171; \"Thoughts swirled in Brett's head like dead leaves in a tornado\". Another image is seen in the closing lines of the novel; \"The grass showed its face, reminding Brett of life and how things thaw, grow, and change.\" - like people. \n The dialogue in Cache a Predator is precise and nicely done conveying bits of relief when needed. The characters are realistic with no character being perfect. They all have the problems of their past which shape their present. The plot is held together well with a quick but good pace, and with good rise-and-fall in tension. There are, also, many interesting images throughout the novel. \n **Note: I received a free copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.", "date_added": "Sun Aug 25 05:12:10 -0700 2013", "date_updated": "Fri Dec 26 12:42:51 -0800 2014", "read_at": "", "started_at": "", "n_votes": 3, "n_comments": 2}

In the film she was a minor character and a strong one at that, in the book she is a whiner that Brody should have booted out. Once the affair happened then it was like she was gone? So much about her before and then poof! \n Honestly, not one character had any redeeming value. I was rooting for the shark to take them all out! \n I can only imagine the reason this book became so big because it was one of the first book's written about a man-eating Great White Shark.

James ha voluto scrivere un giallo con i personaggi di Jane Austen, ma si puo veramente parlare di giallo? Oppure sarebbe meglio considerare il tutto come una mera costruzione affinche questo libro potesse assomigliare ad un giallo?? \n Analizzando il tutto credo che l'unico sbaglio possa essere la presenza di Lydia. Lei, unica testimone di un fatto, non viene nemmeno interrogata, lasciando tutti alle loro speculazioni. \n La presenza di Lydia in questo romanzo potrebbe spiegarsi solamente con l'attaccamento che questa scrittrice ha nei suoi confronti, ma, in questo caso, difficilmente si spiegherebbe le sue rare apparse. \n Fatto sta che senza Lydia, la struttura del giallo avrebbe retto, con lei, fa acqua da tutte le parti... non che il resto non sia da criticare, ma il giallo sicuramente sarebbe apparso migliore. \n I personaggi di Jane Auste, cosi come rappresentati dalla James, lasciano un po a desiderare. Elizabeth, mi pare debole, manca di quel \"guizzo\" che la caratterizza e i suoi rapporti con il marito sono dolci, ma distaccati. \n Georgiana, fa un salto di qualita, ma forse un salto un po' troppo marcato, e i suoi rapporti con il fratello mi sembrano un po' troppo freddi, considerando il calore che li caratterizzava in Orgoglio e Pregiudizio. \n Il colonnello Fitzwiliam ha perduto quel poco di fascino che ricordavo ed e diventato un arrogantello, saputello che ho odiato dal primo momento. E non mi interessano le varie ragioni che lo hanno spinto a comportarsi cosi e che si sono rivelate nello svolgimento della trama, e arrogante e tanto basta. \n Lo ammetto, nei derivati che leggo ODIO, che vengano riproposti, come ricordi, brani del libro originale dal quale derivano. E' palese che se sono al corrente che c'e un collegamento tra un libro ed un altro, mi leggo prima l'originale e poi il derivato. \n Ammetto che questo espediente possa rendere accessibile a tutti anche il passato dei protagonisti, ma rende la lettura pesante e certi espedienti per introdurre un determinato brano risultavano a dir poco ridicoli! \n Per non parlare di come tutto il testo originale venisse distorto, portando a conclusioni completamente errate. \n Lo stile e, fortunatamente, scorrevole e questo mi ha garantito una piacevole lettura seppur intervallata da frequenti smorfie relative al contenuto. \n Sono consapevole che sia una forte tentazione quella di voler rendere omaggio ad una grande scrittrice come Jane Austen, ma credo che sia necessario uno studio approfondito per poter conoscere il carattere dei personaggi, i loro pensieri e le loro intenzioni, prima di poter scrivere qualcosa che renda veramente giustizia alle sue opere. \n Sono convinta che, se non fosse firmato P.D. James, questo libro non avrebbe fatto molto successo...", "date_added": "Mon Sep 14 12:06:01 -0700 2015", "date_updated": "Fri May 27 02:51:16 -0700 2016", "read_at": "Sun Apr 17 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "started_at": "Wed Apr 06 00:00:00 -0700 2016", "n_votes": 0, "n_comments": 0}
