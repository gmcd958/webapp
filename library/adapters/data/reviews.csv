1,1,1,"I haven't read a fun mystery book in a while and not sure I've ever read Crowner Royal. Was looking for a fun read set in France while I was on holiday there and this didn't disappoint! Fast paced and good mystery. \n One that struck me was how similar Poirot is to Sherlock. They are both detectives, have a ex-military sidekick who is telling the story, and solve mysteries using their superior wit. Poirot seems like a French Sherlock. I'm curious if he was inspired by Sherlock.",Sun Jul 30 09:28:03 -0700 2017
