    Welcome to my book catalogue.

  <h3>
    Please use the left hand navigation panel to browse through my collection of books.

  <h3>
    Please note that the authors do not match the book cover image. This is because I wanted to show collections of books from one author, but all the books from the initial data set I chose have different authors. This is intentional :)
